       "  'Pakistan is considered by the World Health Organization to currently have a \"concentrated\" HIV-1 epidemic due to a rapid rise in infections among people who inject drugs (PWID). Prevalence among the country\\'s nearly 105,000 PWID is estimated to be 37.8% but has been shown to be higher in several large urban centers. A lack of public health resources, the common use of professional injectors and unsafe injection practices are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Here we evaluate the molecular characteristics of HIV-1 sequences (n = 290) from PWID in several Pakistani cities to examine transmission dynamics and the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission with regards to regional trends in opioid trafficking. Tip-to-tip (patristic) distance based phylogenetic cluster inferences and BEAST2 Bayesian phylodynamic analyses of time-stamped data were performed on HIV-1 pol sequences generated from dried blood spots collected from 1,453 PWID as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in Pakistan during 2014/2015. Overall, subtype A1 strains were dominant (75.2%) followed by CRF02_AG (14.1%), recombinants/unassigned (7.2%), CRF35_AD (2.1%), G (1.0%) and C (0.3%). Nearly three quarters of the PWID HIV-1 sequences belonged to one of five distinct phylogenetic clusters. Just below half (44.4%) of individuals in the largest cluster (n = 118) did seek help injecting from professional injectors which was previously identified as a strong correlate of HIV-1 infection. Spikes in estimated HIV-1 effective population sizes coincided with increases in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Pakistan\\'s western neighbor. Structured coalescent analysis was undertaken in order to investigate the spatial relationship of HIV-1 transmission among the various cities under study. In general terms, our analysis placed the city of Larkana at the center of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistan which is consistent with previous epidemiological data.'),\n",

The social networks in which YBMSM are embedded are generally understood to be critical factors in understanding their vulnerability. In this study, we acknowledge the relational richness of YBMSMs' social environments (what we define as multiplexity) and their increasing prioritization of online social networking sites (SNS). Specifically, we investigate whether protective and/or risky features of YBMSMs' Facebook friendships and group affiliations are related to their HIV prevention and sex behavior engagement, while also accounting for features of their offline confidant (or support) and sex networks. Using data from a population-based cohort study of YBMSM living in Chicago (N=268), we perform a series of multiple logistic regression analyses to examine associations between features of YBMSMs' Facebook, confidant, and sexual networks with three prevention outcomes and three sex behavior outcomes, while also controlling for factors at the individual and structural levels. Results show that network features play a more significant role in predicting engagement in sex behaviors than prevention behaviors. Specifically, having more confidants, having confidants who are family members, meeting sex partners online, having more YBMSM Facebook friends, belonging to Facebook groups with an LGBTQ focus, and having greater subject diversity in one's Facebook group affiliations were significantly associated with one or more sex behavior outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for HIV prevention intervention efforts.\"),\n",

Knowledge of HIV status is associated with better reproductive health choices and outcomes for the infant's HIV status. We analyzed trends in known current HIV status among pregnant women attending the first antenatal care (ANC) visit in Uganda, 2012-2016. METHODS: We conducted secondary data analysis using District Health Information Software2 data on all pregnant women who came for ANC visit during 2012-2016. Women who brought documented HIV negative test result within the previous 4 weeks at the first ANC visit or an HIV positive test result and/or own HIV care card were considered as knowing their HIV status. We calculated proportions of women with known current HIV status at first ANC visit, and described linear trends both nationally and regionally. We tested statistical significance of the trend using modified Poisson regression with generalized linear models. For known HIV positive status, we only analyzed data for years 2015-2016 because this is when this data became available. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the number of women that attended first ANC visits over years 2012-2016. The proportion of women that came with known HIV status increased from 4.4% in 2012 to 6.9% in 2016 and this increase was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Most regions had an increase in trend except the West Nile and Mid-Eastern (p < 0.001). The proportion of women that came knowing their HIV positive status at first ANC visit was slightly higher than that of women that were newly tested HIV positive at first ANC visit in 2015 and 2016. CONCLUSION: Although the gap in women that come at first ANC visit without knowing their HIV positive status might be reducing, a large proportion of women who were infected with HIV did not know their status before the first ANC visit indicating a major public health gap. We recommend advocacy for early ANC attendance and hence timely HIV testing and innovations to promptly identify HIV positive women of reproductive age so that timely PMTCT interventions can be made.\"),\n",

Abstinence-reinforcing contingency management (CM) reduces drug use and could also improve HIV outcomes. METHODS: From 2012-2017, we conducted a randomized controlled trial testing whether a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention improved HIV viral load (VL) among HIV-infected adults using opioids or cocaine. In the CM intervention, drug-free urines led to escalating value of vouchers ($2.50-$80/voucher, $1320 total maximum). In intention-to-treat mixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses, we examined whether the CM intervention improved log10 VL (primary outcome), abstinence and antiretroviral adherence (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants were randomized to the CM intervention and 36 to control. Median age was 49.2 years; most were male (61.6%) and non-Hispanic black (46.6%). In CM (vs. control) participants, mean reduction in log10 VL was greater (-0.16 log10 VL copies/mL per 4-week period; 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.03, p < 0.05). Over 16 weeks, CM participants had a mean reduction of 0.64 copies/mL in log10 VL greater than control participants. The CM intervention was not significantly associated with abstinence or adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate improvements in HIV VL via an abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention. Because the CM intervention did not significantly affect abstinence or adherence, the mechanism of its effect is unclear. To end the HIV epidemic, innovative strategies must address individuals with poor HIV outcomes. Abstinence-reinforcing CM may be one potential strategy to improve HIV outcomes among a select group of PWUD.'),\n",

       "  'The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex and well-balanced milieu of anatomic and immunological barriers. The epithelial surface of the GI tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiota, which is considered an \"organ\" with distinctive endocrine and immunoregulatory functions. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota composition, termed dysbiosis, has been associated with epithelial damage and translocation of microbial products into the circulating blood. Dysbiosis, increased gut permeability and chronic inflammation play a major role on the clinical outcome of inflammatory bowel diseases, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and HIV infection. In this review, we focus on GVHD and HIV infection, conditions sharing gut immune damage leading to dysbiosis. The degree of dysbiosis and level of epithelial gut damage predict poor clinical outcome in both conditions. Emerging interventions are therefore warranted to promote gut microbiota homeostasis and improve intestinal barrier function. Interventions such as anti-inflammatory medications, and probiotics have toxicity and/or limited transitory effects, justifying innovative approaches. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is one such approach where fecal microorganisms are transferred from healthy donors into the GI tract of the recipient to restore microbiota composition in patients with Clostridium difficile-induced colitis or inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary findings point toward a beneficial effect of FMT to improve GVHD and HIV-related outcomes through the engraftment of beneficial donor bacteria, notably those producing anti-inflammatory metabolites. Herein, we critically review the potential for FMT in alleviating dysbiosis and gut damage in patients with GVHD or HIV-infection. Understanding the underlying mechanism by which FMT restores gut function will pave the way toward novel scalable and targeted interventions.'),\n",

METHODS: Previously-diagnosed MSM and TGW living with HIV who enrolled in the TRUST/RV368 cohort from March 2013 to August 2018 were asked, \"Have you told your (male/female) sexual partners (MSP/FSP) that you are living with HIV?\" In separate analyses, robust Poisson regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for characteristics associated with HIV status disclosure to MSP and FSP. Self-reported stigma indicators were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of 493 participants living with HIV, 153 (31.0%) had disclosed their HIV status to some or all MSP since being diagnosed. Among 222 with FSP, 34 (15.3%) had disclosed to some or all FSP. Factors independently associated with disclosure to MSP included living in Lagos (RR 1.58 [95% CI 1.14-2.20]) and having viral load < 50 copies/mL (RR 1.67 [95% CI 1.24-2.25]). Disclosure to FSP was more common among participants who were working in entertainment industries (RR 6.25 [95% CI 1.06-36.84]) or as drivers/laborers (RR 6.66 [95% CI 1.10-40.36], as compared to unemployed) and also among those married/cohabiting (RR 3.95 [95% CI 1.97-7.91], as compared to single) and prescribed ART (RR 2.27 [95% CI 1.07-4.83]). No differences in self-reported stigma indicators were observed by disclosure status to MSP but disclosure to FSP was associated with a lower likelihood of ever having been assaulted (26.5% versus 45.2%, p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: HIV status disclosure to sexual partners was uncommon among Nigerian MSM and TGW living with HIV but was associated with improved HIV care outcomes. Disclosure was not associated with substantially increased experiences of stigma.

Our objective is to provide qualitative insights into the reasons why PLWHIV might prefer one of these HIV control therapies over others. From May to August 2018, we implemented a semistructured cross-sectional survey of PLWHIV in the United States to better understand patient preferences around various HIV treatment and remission options. Using free text, respondents were asked to explain why they preferred one HIV control option over the other two. We analyzed responses to the open-ended survey questions on reasons for preferring oral daily ART versus LA-ART versus HIV remission strategies using conventional content analysis. The results showed that PLWHIV preferred oral daily ART because of its familiarity and known safety and efficacy profile, whereas those who preferred LA-ART would value the convenience it offers. Finally, HIV remission strategies would be preferred to avoid taking ART altogether. The qualitative results provide insights into reasons why PLWHIV in the United States might prefer oral daily ART versus novel therapies. More importantly, they provide information to better align HIV virological control strategies with end-user perspectives. To make informed choices around evolving HIV therapeutics, PLWHIV and HIV care providers would benefit from decision tools to better assess options and trade-offs. More research is needed on how best to effectively support PLWHIV and HIV care providers in shared decision-making.'),\n",

RESULTS: Among 40 participants tested longitudinally from a median of 7.1 years to 12 years after ART initiation, intact provirus levels declined significantly over time (median half-life, 7.1 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-18), whereas defective provirus levels did not decrease. The median half-life of total HIV-1 DNA was 41.6 years (95% CI, 13.6-75). The proportion of all proviruses that were intact diminished over time on ART, from about 10% at the first on-ART time point to about 5% at the last. Intact provirus levels on ART correlated with total HIV-1 DNA and residual plasma viremia, but there was no evidence for associations between intact provirus levels and inflammation or immune activation.

       "  'INTRODUCTION: HIV testing is a required part of delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. However, repeat testing can be challenging in busy, under-staffed clinical settings, which could negatively impact PrEP uptake and continuation. We prospectively evaluated optional facility-based HIV self-testing (HIVST) among young women using PrEP in an implementation programme. METHODS: Between February and November 2019, we collected data from young women receiving PrEP at two family planning facilities in Kisumu, Kenya. At each PrEP follow-up visit, women were given the option to choose between provider-initiated testing and HIVST. We assessed factors associated with HIVST uptake and compared satisfaction with HIV testing and clinic experience between acceptors and decliners of HIVST. RESULTS: A total of 172 women were offered HIVST at 202 PrEP follow-up visits. The median age was 21 years, 27% had multiple partners and 15% reported previously using HIVST. HIVST was accepted at 34.7% (70/202) of visits. Age (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.09 per year, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.01 to 1.18), never being married (aRR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.95) and having more PrEP follow-up visits (aRR 1.13 per visit, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23) were associated with HIVST uptake. Compared to HIVST decliners, HIVST acceptors were more likely to be very happy with their overall testing experience (73% vs. 47% of visits, p = 0.003) and were more likely to say they would use HIVST in the future (96% vs. 76%, p < 0.001). Women who accepted HIVST had shorter visits than those choosing standard provider-initiated HIV testing (median [IQR]: 33 [32, 38] vs. 54 [41.5, 81] minutes, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot evaluation in Kenya, about one-third of women using PrEP opted for HIVST over provider-initiated testing, and those choosing HIVST spent less time in the clinic and were generally satisfied with their experience. HIVST in PrEP delivery is feasible and has the potential to simplify PrEP delivery and give clients testing autonomy. Additional studies are needed to explore optimal HIV retesting strategies in PrEP delivery, including the use of HIVST in PrEP at a larger scale and in different settings.'),\n",

Here, we show that the binding of BMS-529 to clade C soluble chimeric gp140 SOSIP (ch.SOSIP) and membrane-bound trimers with intact transmembrane domain (gp150) prevented trimer conformational transitions and enhanced their immunogenicity. When complexed to BMS-529, ch.SOSIP trimers retained their binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and to their unmutated common ancestor (UCA) antibodies, while exposure of CD4-induced (CD4i) non-bNAb epitopes was inhibited. BMS-529-complexed gp150 trimers in detergent micelles, which were isolated from CHO cells, bound to bNAbs, including UCA and intermediates of the CD4 binding site (bs) CH103 bNAb lineage, and showed limited exposure of CD4i epitopes and a glycosylation pattern with a preponderance of high-mannose glycans. In rabbits, BMS-529-complexed V3 glycan-targeting ch.SOSIP immunogen induced in the majority of immunized animals higher neutralization titers against both autologous and select high mannose-bearing heterologous tier 2 pseudoviruses than those immunized with the noncomplexed ch.SOSIP. In rhesus macaques, BMS-529 complexed to CD4 bs-targeting ch.SOSIP immunogen induced stronger neutralization against tier 2 pseudoviruses bearing high-mannose glycans than noncomplexed ch.SOSIP trimer immunogen. When immunized with gp150 complexed to BMS-529, rhesus macaques showed neutralization against tier 2 pseudoviruses with targeted glycan deletion and high-mannose glycan enrichment. These results demonstrated that stabilization of Env trimer conformation with BMS-529 improved the immunogenicity of select chimeric SOSIP trimers and elicited tier 2 neutralizing antibodies of higher potency than noncomplexed trimers.IMPORTANCE Soluble forms of HIV-1 envelope trimers exhibit conformational heterogeneity and undergo CD4-induced (CD4i) exposure of epitopes of non-neutralizing antibodies that can potentially hinder induction of broad neutralizing antibody responses. These limitations have been mitigated through recent structure-guided approaches and include trimer-stabilizing mutations that resist trimer conformational transition and exposure of CD4i epitopes. The use of small-molecule viral inhibitors that allosterically block CD4 binding represents an alternative strategy for stabilizing Env trimer in the pre-CD4-triggered state of both soluble and membrane-bound trimers. In this study, we report that the viral entry inhibitor BMS-626529 restricts trimer conformational transition and improves the immunogenicity of select Env trimer immunogens.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for better health outcomes among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Nearly 30% of the 1.6 million PLHIV in Tanzania are not on treatment. Since HIV positive status is the only eligibility criterion for ART use, it is critical to understand the obstacles to ART access and uptake to reach universal coverage of ART among PLHIV. For the caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) LHIV and not on ART, attempts to identify them and ensure that they initiate and continue using ART is critical for their wellbeing and their ability to care for their children. METHODS: Data are from the community-based, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kizazi Kipya project that aims at scaling up the uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services by orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and their caregivers. HIV positive caregivers of OVC who were enrolled in the USAID Kizazi Kipya project between January 2017 and June 2018 were included in this cross-sectional study. The caregivers were drawn from 11 regions: Arusha, Iringa, Katavi, Kigoma, Mara, Mbeya, Morogoro, Ruvuma, Simiyu, Singida, and Tanga. The outcome variable was ART status (either using or not), which was enquired of each OVC caregiver LHIV at enrollment. Data analysis involved multivariable analysis using random-effects logistic regression to identify correlates of ART use. RESULTS: In total, 74,999 caregivers living with HIV with mean age of 44.4 years were analyzed. Of these, 96.4% were currently on ART at enrollment. In the multivariable analysis, ART use was 30% lower in urban than in rural areas (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.81). Food security improved the odds of being on ART (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.15-1.45). Disabled caregivers were 42% less likely than non-disabled ones to be on ART (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.76). Male caregivers with health insurance were 43% more likely than uninsured male caregivers to be on ART (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.83). Caregivers aged 40-49 years had 18% higher likelihood of being on ART than the youngest ones. Primary education level was associated with 26% increased odds of being on ART than no education (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41). CONCLUSIONS: Although nearly all the caregivers LHIV in the current study were on ART (96.4%), more efforts are needed to achieve universal coverage. The unreached segments of the population LHIV, even if small, may lead to worse health outcomes, and also spur further spread of the HIV epidemic due to unachieved viral suppression. Targeting caregivers in urban areas, food insecure households, who are uninsured, and those with mental or physical disability can improve ART coverage among caregivers LHIV.'),\n",

We compared the epidemiology of HIV infection between US-born and non-US-born residents of the United States and examined the characteristics of non-US-born people with diagnosed HIV infection by region of birth (ROB). METHODS: We used a cross-sectional study design to produce national, population-based data describing HIV infection among US-born and non-US-born people. We analyzed National HIV Surveillance System data for people with HIV infection diagnosed during 2010-2017 and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We compared data on demographic characteristics, transmission risk category, and stage 3 infection (AIDS) classification within 3 months of HIV diagnosis, by nativity and ROB. RESULTS: During 2010-2017, 328 317 children and adult US residents were diagnosed with HIV infection and were reported to CDC: 214 973 (65.5%) were US-born, 50 301 (15.3%) were non-US-born, and 63 043 (19.2%) were missing data on country of birth. After adjusting for missing country of birth, 266 147 (81.1%) people were US-born and 62 170 (18.9%) were non-US-born. This group accounted for 15 928 of 65 645 (24.2%) HIV diagnoses among girls and women and 46 242 of 262 672 (17.6%) HIV diagnoses among boys and men. A larger percentage of non-US-born people than US-born people had stage 3 infection (AIDS) at HIV diagnosis (31.2% vs 23.9%). Among non-US-born people with HIV diagnoses, 19 876 (39.5%) resided in the South.

       "  'Background: Although Tanzania experiences a general decline in HIV prevalence, some populations such as caregivers of orphans may be at a higher risk than the general population, suggesting that infection pathways still need further exploration. This study examines how food insufficiency relates to HIV infection among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Tanzania. Data and Methods: Data are from a community-based, USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project that aims at increasing the uptake of HIV services, as well as other health and social services by OVC and their caregivers in Tanzania. Caregivers who were enrolled in the project from January to July 2017 in seven regions of Tanzania, and had reported their HIV status to the project, were included in the analysis. While HIV status was the outcome, the main independent variable was food insufficiency which was assessed using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS). Using Stata (version 14.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), data analysis involved multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression.. Results: Of the 47,617 caregivers analyzed (73.7% females), 61.8% and 4.6% were experiencing moderate and severe hunger, respectively. The overall HIV prevalence among the caregivers was 28.3%. Nevertheless, the prevalence was as high as 34.2% among caregivers in severe hunger households. Multivariate analysis revealed an increasing likelihood of being HIV positive as hunger increased (moderate hunger: OR=1.10, 95%CI: 1.03-1.18; severe hunger: OR=1.51, 95%CI: 1.32-1.74). These observations were adjusted for marital status, age, sex, education, place of residence, family size, disability status, and health insurance. Conclusion: Food insufficiency is associated with a higher likelihood of HIV infection among OVC caregivers in Tanzania, suggesting that improving access to adequate food has a potential to reduce HIV risks among them. Furthermore, food insufficiency could be considered an important criterion for targeting HIV testing and treatment services to expand coverage.'),\n",

DESIGN: Micro-costing analysis using longitudinal data from a real-world intervention. METHODS: We collected data prospectively on provider's costs and programmatic outcomes over three time periods of approximately 8 months each, between May 2017 and April 2019. The scope of services was extended during each period as follows: HTS only, HTS and HIVST, HTS and HIVST with individual HIVST booths wherein clients were encouraged to self-test on-site followed by on-site confirmative testing for those with reactive self-test. For each implementation period, we estimated the full financial and economic implementation costs, the incremental costs of adding HIVST onto conventional HTS and the cost per HIV positive case identified. RESULTS: Costs per HIV-positive case identified increased between period 1 (US$956) and period 2 (US$1249) then dropped in period 3 (US$813). Full versus incremental cost analyses resulted in large differences in the magnitude of costs, attributable to methods rather than resource use: for example, in period 3, the average full and incremental cost estimates for HTS were US$34.3 and US$23.5 per person tested, and for HIVST were US$37.7 and US$14.0 per kit provided, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Lesotho, adding HIVST to community-based HTS improves its overall affordability for HIV-positive case finding. The reporting of both full and incremental cost estimates increase transparency for use in priority setting, budgeting and financial planning for scale-up.\"),\n",

METHODS: Participants were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018 from three sites in Homa Bay County, Nyanza region, western Kenya. We explored two recruitment approaches (home-based vs. mobile-event based) and three HIV testing options (oral self-test, staff-administered, or referral to health facility). Exact logistic regression compared yield of newly diagnosed HIV and high-risk HIV-negatives from the recruitment and testing option strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1,198 participants were enrolled, 1,046 (87.3%) at home and 152 (12.7%) at mobile events. Most participants (928, 77.5%) chose staff-aided testing either at home or at a mobile event; 268 (22.4%) chose self-testing; and only 2 (.2%) chose facility referral. Prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV-positives was 2.7% (32/1,198) and 36.8% (429/1,166) of HIV-negative AGYW were identified as high risk. We identified more newly diagnosed HIV infection among AGYW recruited at mobile events than at home (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.33-6.74; p = .02). High-risk status was related to neither recruitment strategy nor testing modality. Older age was associated with increased odds of selecting an oral self-test (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.06-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of AGYW were at elevated risk of HIV infection, and those unaware of their HIV infection were more likely to be identified at a mobile outreach. Though self-testing was not the dominant preferred strategy, self-tests were performed accurately and with high confidence. These findings can help inform efficient identification of undiagnosed HIV infection and high risk for seroconversion among AGYW in similar settings.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: The nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) is a novel pro-drug of tenofovir (TFV) and possesses a superior renal safety profile compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF). Due to unique pharmacokinetic characteristics, treatment with TAF is not associated with significant renal proximal tubular accumulation of TFV. TAF is associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and renal proximal tubular dysfunction than treatment with TDF. No cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported in clinical trials of TAF. It is unknown whether treatment with TAF can lead to accumulation of TFV in proximal tubular cells and cause nephrotoxicity under certain clinical circumstances. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a patient on stable TAF-based antiretroviral therapy with for HIV-1 infection who developed proximal tubulopathy when treated with gentamicin for febrile neutropenia in the context of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighteen days after commencing chemotherapy for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma the patient presented to hospital with fevers, hypotension and neutropenia. The patient was commenced on piperacillin, tazobactam and gentamicin. Within 24 h the patient developed marked hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia requiring intravenous replacement therapy. There was proteinuria, glycosuria and evidence of marked urinary electrolyte wasting, consistent with acute proximal tubular dysfunction. Eleven days after the gentamicin was stopped the serum biochemistry normalised. The urinary electrolyte wasting and proteinuria had improved, and the glycosuria had resolved. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report to describe acute renal proximal tubulopathy in an HIV-infected patient treated with TAF and gentamicin. As the number of patients prescribed TAF outside the clinical trial setting increases, so too does the potential for previously unreported drug interactions and adverse events. Clinicians need to be aware of potential unreported adverse drug reactions as the use of TAF becomes increasingly common in clinical practice.'),\n",

We investigated the costs and efficiency of HIV services in relation to HIV testing yield in rural Karonga District, Malawi. METHODS: Costs of HIV services were measured over 12 months to September 2017 in five health facilities, drawing on recognised health costing principles. Financial and economic costs were collected in Malawi Kwacha and United States Dollars (US$). Costs were calculated using a provider perspective to estimate average annual costs (2017 US$) per HIV testing episode, per HIV-positive case diagnosed, and per patient-year on antiretroviral therapy (ART), by facility. Costs were assessed in relation to scale of operation and facility-level annual HIV positivity rate. A one-way sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand how staffing levels and the HIV positivity rate affected HIV testing costs. RESULTS: HIV testing episodes per day and per full-time equivalent HIV health worker averaged 3.3 (range 2.0 to 5.7). The HIV positivity rate averaged 2.4% (range 1.9 to 3.7%). The average cost per testing episode was US$2.85 (range US$1.95 to US$8.55), and the average cost per HIV diagnosis was US$116.35 (range US$77.42 to US$234.11), with the highest costs found in facilities with the lowest daily number of tests and lowest HIV yield respectively. The mean facility-level cost per patient-year on ART was approximately US$100 (range US$90.67 to US$115.42). ART drugs were the largest cost component averaging 71% (range 55 to 76%). The cost per patient-year of viral load tests averaged US$4.50 (range US$0.52 to US$7.00) with cost variation reflecting differences in the tests to ART patient ratio across facilities. CONCLUSION: Greater efficiencies in HIV service delivery are possible in Karonga through increasing daily testing episodes among existing health workers or allocating health workers to tasks in addition to testing. Costs per diagnosis will increase as yields decline, and therefore, encouraging targeted testing strategies that increase yield will be more efficient. Given the contribution of drug costs to per patient-year treatment costs, it is critical to preserve the life-span of first-line ART regimens, underlining the need for continuing adherence support and regular viral load monitoring.'),\n",

Gay and bisexual men represent one of the highest risk groups for depression, which potentially poses quality-of-life and public health challenges comparable to those of HIV. The present study seeks to inform comprehensive care for sexual minority men by estimating and comparing the morbidity of HIV and depression for US gay and bisexual men. METHODS: In 2018, weighted counts of gay and bisexual men living with HIV and depression were derived from the CDC's Medical Monitoring Project and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, respectively. Years lived with disability for HIV and depression were calculated using the Global Burden of Disease Study's disability weights. FINDINGS: Among gay and bisexual adult men in the US, the prevalence of past-year major depressive episodes is 14.17%, while the prevalence of HIV is 11.52%. We estimate that in calendar year 2015, major depressive episodes imposed 85,361 (95% CI 58,293-112,212) years lived with disability among US adult gay and bisexual men, whereas HIV posed 42,981 (95% CI 36,221-49,722) years lived with disability. INTERPRETATION: This analysis shows that depression morbidity currently exceeds that for HIV among US adult gay and bisexual men. While gay and bisexual men are frequently understood to be a high-risk population for HIV, including in guidelines for HIV prevention and treatment, the present analysis suggests that this population should also be considered high-risk for depression.\"),\n",

METHODS: From January 2013 to April 2019, adults with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/mL underwent ART history review and HIVDR testing upon enrollment at 12 clinics in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria. We calculated resistance scores for specific drugs and tallied major mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) using Stanford HIVDB 8.8 and SmartGene IDNS software. For ART-naive participants, World Health Organization surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were noted. RESULTS: HIVDR testing was performed on 972 participants with median age 35.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 29.7-42.7) years and median CD4 295 (IQR 148-478) cells/mm3. Among 801 ART-naive participants, the prevalence of SDRMs was 11.0%, NNRTI mutations 8.2%, NRTI mutations 4.7%, and PI mutations 0.4%.

Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined.'),\n",

However, unintended consequences included women attending without partners, being refused or delayed access to antenatal services. Some women were required to obtain letters from village leaders to justify the absence of their partners, again to delaying or disrupting care-seeking. When partners attended antenatal care, consultations were reportedly more likely to focus on HIV testing, and less on antenatal or neonatal care. Strategies to increase men's attendance at HIV clinics with their partners can promote mutual support within couples for HIV care engagement, but may risk undermining engagement in pregnancy and HIV care for some women if over-stringently applied.

Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the completion rate of IPT and predictive factors among PLHIV attending six government hospitals in Kebbi state, Northern Nigeria. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of program data spanning a 5-year period (December 2010-June 2016). Data were collected between January 2017 and June 2017. Results: A total of 1,134 IPT patients were enrolled of whom 740 (65.3%) were female. The mean age was 40.3 +/- 3.7 years. Four hundred and fifty-four (40%) of those who initiated IPT completed the 6-month course. Of the 680 (60%) IPT noncompleters, 117 (17.2%) were lost to follow-up by month 1, 305 (44.9%) by month 2, 156 (22.9%) by month 3, 48 (7.1%) by month 4, and 54 (7.9%) by month 5.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of cohort study in the United Kingdom and Ireland. METHODS: Pain information was collected during the baseline visit (conducted from 2013 to 2015) through a self-completed manikin identifying pain at 15 sites from five body regions. Pain was classified as widespread if reported at at least four regions and at least seven sites, or regional otherwise. Chi-squared tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and ordinal logistic regression were used to consider associations between pain extent and sociodemographic and HIV-related factors. RESULTS: Among the 1207 participants (614 PWH >/= 50 years, 330 PWH < 50 years, 263 HIV-negative controls >/=50 years), pain was most commonly reported at the upper (left: 28.9%, right: 28.0%) and lower (left: 25.7%; right: 24.5%) leg, upper (18.6%) and lower (29.7%) back and shoulders (left: 16.0%; right: 16.8%).

DESIGN: Single-arm, open-label pilot study of participants with AHI initiating ritonavir-boosted darunavir 800 mg once daily and etravirine 400 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily within 30 days of AHI diagnosis. METHODS: Efficacy was defined as HIV RNA less than 200 copies/ml by week 24. Optional sub-studies included pharmacokinetics analysis from genital fluids (weeks 0-4, 12, 48), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (weeks 2-4, 24 and 48) and endoscopic biopsies (weeks 4-12 and 36-48). Neuropsychological performance was assessed at weeks 0, 24 and 48. RESULTS: Fifteen AHI participants were enrolled. Twelve (80%) participants achieved HIV RNA less than 200 copies/ml by week 24. Among 12 participants retained through week 48, nine (75%) remained suppressed to less than 50 copies/ml. The median time from ART initiation to suppression less than 200 and less than 50 copies/ml was 59 and 86 days, respectively. The penetration ratios for etravirine and darunavir in gut associated lymphoid tissue were 19.2 and 3.05, respectively. Most AHI participants achieving viral suppression experienced neurocognitive improvement. Of the three participants without overall improvement in neurocognitive functioning as measured by impairment ratings (more than two tests below 1 SD), two had virologic failure. CONCLUSION: NRTI-sparing ART started during AHI resulted in rapid viral suppression similar to NRTI-based regimens. More novel and compact two-drug treatments for AHI should be considered. Early institution of ART during AHI appears to improve overall neurocognitive function and may reduce the risk of subsequent neurocognitive impairment. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV:: NCT00855413.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to disruptions to provision of HIV services for people living with HIV and those at risk of acquiring HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, where UNAIDS estimated that more than two-thirds of the approximately 38 million people living with HIV resided in 2018. We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. FINDINGS: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 1.63 times (median across models; range 1.39-1.87) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296 000 (range 229 023-420 000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1.6 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 1.06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 1.19 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). INTERPRETATION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.'),\n",

DESIGN: Longitudinal study in a multisite observational clinical cohort. METHODS: The Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems patient-reported outcomes survey measures internalized HIV stigma yearly using a four-item assessment (response scale 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). We obtained patient-reported outcome, lab, and appointment data from six center for AIDS research network of integrated clinical systems sites. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between mean stigma and subsequent viremia. We then used Bayesian sequential mediation to fit a longitudinal sequential path model spanning four time points to test if depressive symptoms at T1 and ART adherence at T2 mediated the effect of stigma at T0 on viral load at T3, adjusting for baseline covariates. RESULTS: Between February 2016 and November 2018, 6859 patients underwent stigma assessment and were 81% cis-men, 38% Black, 16% Latinx, 32% heterosexual-identified, and 49% at least 50 years of age. Mean stigma level was 2.00 (SD 1.08). Stigma was significantly associated with subsequent viremia (adjusted odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.28, P = 0.004), as were younger age and Black race. The chained indirect effect from stigma to unsuppressed viral load through depressive symptoms and then adherence was significant (standardized beta = 0.002; SD = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Internalized HIV stigma positively predicts subsequent viremia through depressive symptoms and ART adherence.

For instance, HIV exposed but uninfected infants have higher morbidity and mortality than HIV unexposed infants. Innate responses are the first line of defense and orchestrate the subsequent adaptive immune response and are especially relevant in newborns. To determine the association of maternal HIV infection with maternal and newborn innate immunity we analyzed the cytokine responses upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) stimulations in the triad of maternal peripheral and placental blood as well as in cord blood in a cohort of mother-infant pairs from southern Mozambique. A total of 48 women (35 HIV-uninfected and 13 HIV-infected) were included. Women and infant innate responses positively correlated with each other. Age, gravidity and sex of the fetus had some associations with spontaneous production of cytokines in the maternal peripheral blood. HIV-infected women not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) before pregnancy showed decreased IL-8 and IL-6 PRR responses in peripheral blood compared to those HIV-uninfected, and PRR hyporesponsiveness for IL-8 was also found in the corresponding infant's cord blood. HIV infection had a greater impact on placental blood responses, with significantly increased pro-inflammatory, T H 1 and T H 17 PRR responses in HIV-infected women not receiving ART before pregnancy compared to HIV-uninfected women. In conclusion, innate response of the mother and her newborn was altered by HIV infection in the women who did not receive ART before pregnancy. As these responses could be related to birth outcomes, targeted innate immune modulation could improve maternal and newborn health.\"),\n",

HIV-positive OVC aged 0-14 years who were enrolled in the project from January 2017 to September 2018 were analyzed. ART status (off ART or on ART) was the outcome variable. Multivariate analysis was performed using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Of the 10,047 HIV-positive OVC aged 0-14 years analyzed, 93.5% were currently on ART at enrollment. In the multivariate analysis, OVC with male caregivers were 4-times more likely than those with female caregivers to be on ART (OR=4.03, 95% CI=1.49-10.90). OVC with HIV-positive caregivers were 12-times more likely than those with HIV-negative caregivers to be on ART (OR=12.0, 95% CI=3.81-37.70).

We recruited 92 YALH who were 18 to 34 years old and were newly diagnosed with HIV, had a history of falling out of care, or had a detectable HIV viral load into this intervention. Study participants used the app to manage their HIV care and to communicate and interact with their HIV care team. During the intervention period, the retention rate among our study participants increased from 41.3% at baseline to 78.6% at 6-month follow-up, maintained at 12-month follow-up (79.8%), and slightly decreased to 73.4% at 18-month follow-up but it was still significantly higher than the baseline retention rate (p < .0001). The viral suppression rate (HIV RNA <200 copies/ml) increased from 64.1% at baseline to about 85% at 6-month and at 12-month follow-up and reached 91.4% at 18-month (p = .0002) among participants who were retained in care. Our study demonstrated using a HIPAA-compliant mobile application as an effective intervention to engage YALH in care. This mobile technology-based intervention can be incorporated into routine clinical practice to improve HIV care continuum.'),\n",

Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth approximately 1 year later.

HIV also increases quasispecies diversity of HCV structural genes, although limited data are available regarding the impact of HIV on non-structural genes of HCV, particularly in the absence of direct-acting therapies. The genetic diversity and presence of drug resistance mutations within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) gene were examined in 3 groups of women with HCV genotype 1a infection, including those with HCV mono-infection, antiretroviral (ART)-naive women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3, and ART-naive women with HIV/HCV co-infection and CD4 cell count >/=350 cells/mm3. None had ever been treated for HCV infection. There was evidence of significant diversity across the entire NS5B gene in all women. There were several nucleotides and amino acids with distinct distributions across the three study groups, although no obvious clustering of NS5B sequences was observed based on HIV co-infection or CD4 cell count. Polymorphisms at amino acid positions associated with resistance to dasabuvir and sofosbuvir were limited, although the Q309R variant associated with ribavirin resistance was present in 12 individuals with HCV mono-infection, 8 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 <350 cells/mm3, and 12 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with CD4 >/=350 cells/mm3. Previously reported fitness altering mutations were rare. CD8+ T cell responses against the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B57-restricted epitopes NS5B2629-2637 and NS5B2936-2944 are critical for HCV control and were completely conserved in 44 (51.8%) and 70 (82.4%) study participants.

We sought to quantify missed opportunities for HIV testing during an HIV outbreak among PWID. METHODS: PWID with HIV diagnosed in 5 Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky counties during January 2017-September 2018 who had >/=1 encounter 12 months prior to HIV diagnosis in 1 of 2 Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area healthcare systems were included in the analysis. HIV testing and encounter data were abstracted from electronic health records. A missed opportunity for HIV testing was defined as an encounter for an IDU-related condition where an HIV test was not performed and had not been performed in the prior 12 months. RESULTS: Among 109 PWID with HIV diagnosed who had >/=1 healthcare encounter, 75 (68.8%) had >/=1 IDU-related encounters in the 12 months before HIV diagnosis. These 75 PWID had 169 IDU-related encounters of which 86 (50.9%) were missed opportunities for HIV testing and occurred among 46 (42.2%) PWID. Most IDU-related encounters occurred in the emergency department (118/169; 69.8%). Using multivariable generalized estimating equations, HIV testing was more likely in inpatient compared with emergency department encounters (adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70-4.33) and at the healthcare system receiving funding for emergency department HIV testing (adjusted RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.10-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: PWID have frequent IDU-related encounters in emergency departments.

The basic tenets of network interventions such as (1) selection of a change agent, (2) segmentation, (3) induction, and (4) alteration represent myriad ways to structure network interventions for HIV prevention with the potential for large public health impact. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have employed the use of social networking websites such as Facebook to identify key persons to recruit others and disseminate information aimed at decreasing HIV transmission and improving safe sex practices among groups who are more vulnerable to HIV acquisition. Many of these interventions have successfully decreased HIV risk behaviors as well as decreased the spread of HIV among intervention cohorts. Network interventions for HIV prevention provide more opportunities to reach populations who have not been reached through typical efforts employed in clinical and public health settings, though they are not currently widely employed by the public health community and other stakeholders.'),\n",

Lifetime ART medication history was obtained from medical health records. We evaluated the role of ART exposure as a predictor of neurocognitive impairment using univariate analyses and machine learning, while accounting for potential effects of demographic, clinical, and comorbidity-related risk factors. Out of a total of 26 tested variables, two random forest analyses identified the most important characteristics of a neurocognitively impaired group (N = 59): Compared with a neurocognitively high-performing group (N = 132; F1-score = 0.79), we uncovered 13 important risk factors; compared with an intermediate-performing group (N = 152; F1-score = 0.75), 16 risk factors emerged. Longer lifetime ART exposure, especially to integrase inhibitors, was one of the most important predictors of neurocognitive impairment in both analyses (rank 2 of 13 and rank 4 of 16, respectively), superseding effects of age (rank 11/13, rank 15/16) and HIV duration (rank 13/13, rank 16/16). Concerning specific integrase inhibitors, the impaired group had significantly longer dolutegravir exposure (p = 0.011) compared with the high-performing group (p = 0.012; trend compared with the intermediate group p = 0.063).

A key function of Nef is to remove the CD4 receptor from the cell surface by hijacking clathrin- and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis. However, exactly how Nef does this has been elusive. Here, we describe the underlying mechanism as revealed by a 3.0-A crystal structure of a fusion protein comprising Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 bound to the tetrameric AP2 complex. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. A pocket on Nef previously identified as crucial for recruiting class I MHC is also responsible for recruiting CD4, revealing a potential approach to inhibit two of Nef's activities and sensitize the virus to immune clearance.\"),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Diarrhea in infancy can compromise linear growth and this relationship is likely influenced by diarrhea severity, number of episodes, and the timing of those episodes. HIV exposed, uninfected infants (HEU) have higher risk of growth faltering, infectious morbidity and mortality than HIV-unexposed infants and may be representative of children particularly vulnerable to diarrhea-associated linear growth faltering. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We utilized data from a cohort of Kenyan HEU infants followed from birth to 12 months of age. Infant length and morbidity were ascertained at monthly study visits and sick visits. Longitudinal models estimated the association between diarrhea severity and length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) in the following month, at 12 months of age, and in 6-month intervals. The 372 enrolled infants experienced an average of 2.15 episodes (range: 0-8) of diarrhea and 0.54 episodes (0-4) of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) between birth and 12 months. Surviving infants had a mean LAZ of -0.97 (standard deviation: 1.2) at 12 months. MSD was significantly associated with an average loss of 0.14 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.24, -0.05, p = 0.003) in LAZ one month after the episode. Linear growth outcomes were not predicted by cumulative episodes of diarrhea, or timing of diarrhea during infancy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diarrhea severity influenced the relationship between diarrhea and subsequent linear growth. HEU infants with MSD may benefit from nutritional interventions following severe diarrhea to protect against linear growth faltering.'),\n",

METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted of baseline HPV characteristics of women undergoing visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cryotherapy or LEEP. After a positive VIA in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, data on demographics, CD4 count, and use of antiretroviral therapy and a cervical swab were collected. HPV typing was performed using the Roche Linear Array. RESULTS: Of 175 participants, 86 (49.1%) were HIV-positive and had a higher prevalence of low-risk HPV types (odds ratio [OR] 5.28, P=0.005) compared with HIV-negative women. The most common high-risk (HR)-HPV types in HIV-positive women were HPV 16 (13.9%) and HPV 18 (11.1%). HIV-positive women requiring LEEP were more likely to have HR-HPV types (OR 6.67, P=0.012) and to be infected with multiple HR-HPV types (OR 7.79, P=0.024) compared to those undergoing cryotherapy.

METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and AIDS Indicator Survey. The analysis was performed in three stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights to: i) interpolate HIV data, ii) identify the spatial clusters with the high prevalence of HIV infection, and iii) perform a multivariate complex sample logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 14,779 participants were included in the analysis with an overall HIV prevalence of 9% (7.0% in males and 10.8% in females). The highest prevalence was found in the southern region of Malawi (13.2%), and the spatial interpolation revealed that the HIV epidemic is worse at the south-eastern part of Malawi. The districts in the high HIV prevalent zone of Malawi are Thyolo, Zomba, Mulanje, Phalombe and Blantyre. In central and northern region, the district HIV prevalence map identified Lilongwe in the central region and Karonga in the northern region as districts that equally deserve attention. People residing in urban areas had a 2.2 times greater risk of being HIV-positive compared to their counterparts in the rural areas (AOR = 2.16; 95%CI = 1.57-2.97). Other independent predictors of HIV prevalence were gender, age, marital status, number of lifetime sexual partners, extramarital partners, the region of residence, condom use, history of STI in the last 12 months, and household wealth index. Disaggregated analysis showed in-depth sociodemographic regional variations in HIV prevalence. CONCLUSION: These findings identify high-risk populations and regions to be targeted for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) campaigns, HIV testing, treatment and education to decrease incidence, morbidity, and mortality related to HIV infection in Malawi.'),\n",

It is important to determine the performance of such systems in specific patient populations. We aimed to validate and determine within-day reliability of an IMU system for measuring lower limb gait kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters (TSP) in people with and without HIV. METHODS: Gait was recorded in eight adults with HIV (PLHIV) and eight HIV-seronegative participants (SNP), using IMUs and optical motion capture (OMC) simultaneously. Participants performed six gait trials. Fifteen TSP and 28 kinematic angles were extracted. Intraclass correlations (ICC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess concurrent validity of the IMU system (relative to OMC) separately in PLHIV and SNP. IMU reliability was assessed during within-session retest of trials. ICCs were used to assess relative reliability. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage SEM were used to assess absolute reliability. RESULTS: Between-system TSP differences demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent ICCs (0.71-0.99), except for double support time and temporophasic parameters (< 0.60). All TSP demonstrated good mean absolute percentage errors (</=7.40%). For kinematics, ICCs were acceptable to excellent (0.75-1.00) for all but three range of motion (ROM) and four discrete angles. RMSE and bias were 0.0 degrees -4.7 degrees for all but two ROM and 10 discrete angles. In both groups, TSP reliability was acceptable to excellent for relative (ICC 0.75-0.99) (except for one temporal and two temporophasic parameters) and absolute (%SEM 1.58-15.23) values. Reliability trends of IMU-measured kinematics were similar between groups and demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent relative reliability (ICC 0.76-0.99) and clinically acceptable absolute reliability (SEM 0.7 degrees -4.4 degrees ) for all but two and three discrete angles, respectively. Both systems demonstrated similar magnitude and directional trends for differences when comparing the gait of PLHIV with that of SNP. CONCLUSIONS: IMU-based gait analysis is valid and reliable when applied in PLHIV; demonstrating a sufficiently low precision error to be used for clinical interpretation (< 5 degrees for most kinematics; < 20% for TSP). IMU-based gait analysis is sensitive to subtle gait deviations that may occur in PLHIV.'),\n",

       "  'Detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 protein at a single pg/ml concentration in point-of-care (POC) settings is important because it can facilitate acute HIV infection diagnosis with a detection sensitivity approaching that of laboratory-based assays. However, the limit of detection (LOD) of lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), the most prominent POC diagnostic platform, falls short of that of laboratory protein detection methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Here, we report the development and optimization of a thermal contrast amplification (TCA) LFA that will allow ultrasensitive detection of 8 pg/ml p24 protein spiked into human serum at POC, approaching the LOD of a laboratory test. To achieve this aim, we pursued several innovations as follows: (a) defining a new quantitative figure of merit for LFA design based on the specific to nonspecific binding ratio (BR); (b) using different sizes and shapes of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in the systematic optimization of TCA LFA designs; and (c) exploring new laser wavelengths and power regimes for TCA LFA designs. First, we optimized the blocking buffer for the membrane and running buffer by quantitatively measuring the BR using a TCA reader. The TCA reader interprets the thermal signal (i.e., temperature) of GNPs within the membrane when irradiated by a laser at the plasmon resonance wavelength of the particle. This process results in higher detection and quantitation of GNPs than in traditional visual detection (i.e., color intensity). Further, we investigated the effect of laser power (30, 100, 200 mW), GNP size and shape (30 and 100 nm gold spheres, 150 nm gold-silica shells), and laser wavelength (532, 800 nm). Applying these innovations to a new TCA LFA design, we demonstrated that 100 nm spheres with a 100 mW 532 nm laser provided the best performance (i.e., LOD = 8 pg/ml). This LOD is significantly better than that of the current colorimetric LFA and is in the range of the laboratory-based p24 ELISA. In summary, this TCA LFA for p24 protein shows promise for detecting acute HIV infection in POC settings.'),\n",

However, many people find it challenging to adhere to a daily oral regimen. Chemoprophylaxis with single oral doses of antiretroviral drugs taken before or after sex may better adapt to changing or unanticipated sexual practices and be a desirable alternative to daily PrEP or PEP. We investigated willingness to use a single oral pill before or after sex among men who have sex with men (MSM) and assessed the biological efficacy of a potent antiretroviral combination containing elvitegravir (EVG), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). METHODS: Data on willingness to use single-dose PrEP or PEP were obtained from the 2017 cycle of the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), an annual online behavioral surveillance survey of MSM in the United States. Antiretroviral drug levels were measured in humans and macaques to define drug distribution in rectal tissue and identify clinically relevant doses for macaque modeling studies. The biological efficacy of a single dose of FTC/TAF/EVG as PrEP or PEP was investigated using a repeat-challenge macaque model of rectal HIV infection. FINDINGS: Through pharmacokinetic assessment in humans and macaques we found that EVG penetrates and concentrates in rectal tissues supporting its addition to FTC/TAF to boost and extend chemoprophylactic activity. Efficacy estimates for a single oral dose given to macaques 4h before or 2h after SHIV exposure was 91*7%[35*7%-98*9%] and 100%, respectively, compared to 80*1%[13*9%-95*4%] and 64*6%[-19*4%-89*5%] when single doses were given 6 and 24h post challenge, respectively. A two-dose regimen at 24h and 48h after exposure was also protective [77*1%[1*7%-94*7%]. INTERPRETATION: Informed by user willingness, human and macaque pharmacokinetic data, and preclinical efficacy we show that single-dose prophylaxis before or after sex is a promising HIV prevention strategy. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to determine if any of these strategies will be effective in humans.

       "  \"In sub-Saharan Africa, endemic Kaposi's sarcoma (EnKS) is still prevalent despite high incidence of epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (EpKS) resulting from the on-going HIV-1 epidemic. While KSHV is clearly the etiologic agent of KS, the mechanisms underlying KS development are not fully understood. For example, HIV-1 co-infection and concomitant immune dysfunction have been associated with EpKS development. However, the direct or indirect role(s) of HIV-1, and therefore of immune suppression, in EpKS remains unclear. How, or whether, EpKS is mechanistically distinct from EnKS is unknown. Thus, the absence of HIV-1 co-infection in EnKS provides a unique control for investigating and deciphering whether HIV-1 plays a direct or indirect role in the EpKS tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that HIV-1 co-infection would induce transcriptome changes that differentiate EpKS from EnKS, thereby defining the direct intra-tumor role of HIV-1 in KS. Comparison of ART-treated and -naive patients would further define the impact of ART on the KS transcriptome. We utilized RNA-seq followed by multiparameter bioinformatics analysis to compare transcriptomes from KS lesions to uninvolved control skin. We provide the first transcriptomic comparison of EpKS versus EnKS, ART-treated vs-naive EpKS and male vs female EpKS to define the roles of HIV-1 co-infection, the impact of ART, and gender on KS gene expression profiles. Our findings suggest that ART-use and gender have minimal impact on transcriptome profiles of KS lesions. Gene expression profiles strongly correlated between EpKS and EnKS patients (Spearman r = 0.83, p<10-10). A subset of genes involved in tumorigenesis and inflammation/immune responses showed higher magnitude, but not unique dysregulation in EnKS compared to EpKS. While gender and ART had no detectable contribution, the trend toward higher magnitude of gene dysregulation in EnKS coupled with the absence of HIV-1 transcripts in EpKS may suggest an indirect or systemic effect of HIV-1 to promote KS tumorigenesis.\"),\n",

We sought to explore acceptability and utility of using electronic surveys to conduct health behavior assessments in clinical settings among SMM. METHODS: Among a US nationwide sample of SMM (n = 4187; mean age = 38.3 years; 60% white; 82% HIV-negative), we examined associations of demographics, recruitment venue, sexual behavior characteristics, and recent substance use with participants' comfort communicating verbally and through electronic survey with a health care provider about sexual and substance use behavior. RESULTS: On average, SMM had greater comfort communicating through electronic survey vs. verbally. In our fully adjusted analysis, preference favoring electronic surveys more strongly than verbal communication differed by age (beta = -0.07, P </= 0.001). SMM with a bachelor's degree or more (beta = 0.04, P < 0.05), those recruited from nonclinical settings (beta = 0.06, P </= 0.001), and those without primary care providers (beta = 0.04, P < 0.05) favored electronic surveys more strongly in the fully adjusted multivariable model. SMM who reported any recent casual sex partners (beta = 0.05, P < 0.01), those never tested for HIV (beta = 0.03, P < 0.05), and HIV-negative/unknown men not on PrEP (compared with PrEP users; beta = 0.09, P </= 0.001) also favored electronic surveys in the fully adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing communication barriers by incorporating electronic surveys into patient assessments could help identify HIV testing and PrEP needs for SMM most susceptible to HIV acquisition. Nonetheless, no one screening strategy is likely to work for most SMM, and multiple approaches are needed.\"),\n",

RESULTS: 12.0% (95% confidence interval 6.8 to 20.2) of total study entry cohort (n = 92) or 15.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.8 to 25.3) of those with data to year 5 (n = 72) lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The only statistically significant association with HBsAg loss was lower study entry quantitative HBsAg. CD4 T-cell count increased by a median 245 cells/mm3 between the preTDF sample and 5 years of follow-up. By year 5, 98.5% of the cohort had undetectable HBV DNA (<15 IU/mL) and 91.4% had undetectable HIV RNA (<20 copies/mL). CONCLUSIONS: HBsAg loss was high and ongoing over 5 years of follow-up in HIV-HBV coinfected individuals on TDF-containing ART and undetectable HBV was almost universal. Although the pattern of HBsAg loss temporarily parallels immune reconstitution, we could not identify predictive immune markers. The high rate of HBsAg loss in HIV-HBV coinfection may offer valuable insights into the search for a functional HBV cure.'),\n",

Both ARVs and NAbs prevent new rounds of viral infection, but NAbs may have the additional capacity to accelerate the loss of virus-infected cells through Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated effector functions, which should affect the kinetics of plasma-virus decline. Here, we formally test the role of effector function in vivo by comparing the rate and timing of plasma-virus clearance in response to a single-dose treatment with either unmodified NAb or those with either reduced or augmented Fc function. When infused into viremic simian HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, there was a 21% difference in slope of plasma-virus decline between NAb and NAb with reduced Fc function. NAb engineered to increase FcgammaRIII binding and improve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro resulted in arming of effector cells in vivo, yet led to viral-decay kinetics similar to NAbs with reduced Fc function. These studies show that the predominant mechanism of antiviral activity of HIV NAbs is through inhibition of viral entry, but that Fc function can contribute to the overall antiviral activity, making them distinct from standard ARVs.'),\n",

The intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) is a novel approach to characterizing the HIV-1 reservoir, focusing on the genetic integrity of individual proviruses independent of transcriptional status. It uses multiplex digital droplet PCR to distinguish and separately quantify intact proviruses, defined by a lack of overt fatal defects such as large deletions and APOBEC3G-mediated hypermutation, from the majority of proviruses that have such defects. This distinction is important because only intact proviruses cause viral rebound on ART interruption. To evaluate IPDA performance and provide benchmark data to support its implementation, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 400 HIV-1(+) adults on ART from several diverse cohorts, representing a robust sample of treated HIV-1 infection in the United States. We provide direct quantitative evidence that defective proviruses greatly outnumber intact proviruses (by >12.5 fold). However, intact proviruses are present at substantially higher frequencies (median, 54/10(6) CD4(+) T cells) than proviruses detected by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay, which requires induction and in vitro growth ( approximately 1/10(6) CD4(+) T cells). IPDA amplicon signal issues resulting from sequence polymorphisms were observed in only 6.3% of individuals and were readily apparent and easily distinguished from low proviral frequency, an advantage of the IPDA over standard PCR assays which generate false-negative results in such situations. The large IPDA dataset provided here gives the clearest quantitative picture to date of HIV-1 proviral persistence on ART.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: High, sustained adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for achieving viral suppression, which in turn leads to important individual health benefits and reduced secondary viral transmission. Electronic adherence monitors record a date-and-time stamp with each opening as a proxy for pill-taking behavior. These monitors can be combined with interventions (eg, data-informed adherence counseling, SMS-based adherence support, and/or alarms) and have been shown to improve adherence in multiple settings. Their use, however, has largely been limited to the research context. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to understand factors relevant for implementing a low-cost electronic adherence monitor and associated interventions for routine HIV clinical care in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with health care administrators, clinicians, and ART clients about likes and dislikes of the features and functions of electronic adherence monitors and associated interventions, their potential to influence HIV care, suggestions on how to measure their value, and recommendations for their use in routine care. We used an inductive, content analysis approach to understand participant perspectives, identifying aspects of CFIR most relevant to technology implementation in this setting. RESULTS: We interviewed 34 health care administrators/clinicians and 15 ART clients. Participants largely saw the monitors and associated interventions as favorable and beneficial for supporting adherence and improving clinical outcomes through efficient, differentiated care. Relevant outside factors included structural determinants of health, international norms around supporting adherence, and limited funding that necessitates careful assessment of costs and benefits. Within the clinic, the adherence data were felt likely to improve the quality of counseling and thereby morale, as well as increase the efficiency of care delivery. Existing infrastructure and care expenditures and the need for proper training were other noted considerations. At the individual level, the desire for good health and a welcomed pressure to adhere favored uptake of the monitors, although some participants were concerned with clients not using the monitors as planned and the influence of poverty, stigma, and need for privacy. Finally, participants felt that decisions around the implementation process would have to come from the Ministry of Health and other funders and would be influenced by sustainability of the technology and the target population for its use. Coordination across the health care system would be important for implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost electronic adherence monitoring combined with data-informed counseling, SMS-based support, and/or alarms have potential for use in routine HIV care in Uganda. Key metrics of successful implementation will include their impact on efficiency of care delivery and clinical outcomes with careful attention paid to factors such as stigma and cost. Further theory-driven implementation science efforts will be needed to move promising technology from research into clinical care.

Although disclosure to sexual partners, family members or friends has been extensively studied, disclosure to community-based HIV programs is missing. This study assesses the magnitude of, and factors associated with undisclosed HIV status to a community-based HIV prevention program among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Tanzania. METHODS: Data are from the USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project that seeks to increase uptake of HIV, health, and social services by OVC and their caregivers in Tanzania. Data on OVC caregivers who were enrolled in the project during January-March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania were analyzed. Caregivers included were those who had complete information on their HIV status disclosure, household socioeconomic status, and sociodemographic characteristics. HIV status was self-reported, with undisclosed status representing all those who knew their HIV status but did not disclose it. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, with caregivers' HIV status disclosure being the outcome variable was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis was based on 59,683 OVC caregivers (mean age = 50.4 years), 71.2% of whom were female. Of these, 37.2% did not disclose their HIV status to the USAID Kizazi Kipya program at the time of enrollment. Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of HIV status non-disclosure was significantly higher among: male caregivers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.28); unmarried (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23); widowed (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18); those without health insurance (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.28-1.45); age 61 + years (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.59-1.88); those with physical or mental disability (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25); and rural residents (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34-1.86). HIV status non-disclosure was less likely with higher education (p < 0.001); and with better economic status (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While improved education, economic strengthening support and expanding health insurance coverage appear to improve HIV status disclosure, greater attention may be required for men, unmarried, widowed, rural residents, and the elderly populations for their higher likelihood to conceal HIV status. This is a clear missed opportunity for timely care and treatment services for those that may be HIV positive. Further support is needed to support disclosure in this population.\"),\n",

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3.0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. INTERPRETATION: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Primary care settings provide an opportunity to offer PrEP to a wide range of patients. In this paper, we describe the PrEP Optimisation Intervention (PrEP-OI), which includes a PrEP Coordinator and a web-based panel management tool (called PrEP-Rx), and is targeted at healthcare providers (HCPs) to increase PrEP uptake and persistence among those at risk for acquiring HIV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PrEP-OI study evaluates the efficacy of the PrEP intervention (PrEP Coordinator + PrEP-Rx) to increase PrEP prescriptions through a stepped-wedge design among 10 primary care clinical sites in the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The number of PrEP initiation prescriptions constitute the primary outcome, and we hypothesise that the mean number of PrEP prescriptions written will significantly increase after the clinics initiate PrEP-OI versus before this intervention. Secondary objectives include: 1-differences in PrEP initiation, duration of use and reasons for discontinuation based on patient's age, race/ethnicity and sex/gender, and by clinic and HCP characteristics, 2-sustainability of the intervention during a 12-month follow-up after the stepped-wedge phase, and 3-facilitators and barriers of PrEP delivery and experiences with the proposed PrEP intervention through qualitative interviews with HCPs.

Regardless of treatment status, an aberrant chronic neuro-immune regulation is a crucial contributor to the development of HAND. However, the extent to which inflammation affects brain structures critical for cognitive status remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine associations of peripheral immune markers with cortical thickness and surface area. Participants included 65 treatment-naive HIV-positive individuals and 26 HIV-negative controls. Thickness and surface area of all cortical regions were derived using automated parcellation of T1-weighted images acquired at 3 T. Peripheral immune markers included C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Associations of these markers with thickness and surface area of cortical regions were evaluated. A mediation analysis examined whether associations of inflammatory markers with cognitive functioning were mediated by brain cortical thickness and surface area. After controlling for multiple comparisons, higher NGAL was associated with reduced thickness of the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex in HIV-positive participants. The association of NGAL with worse motor function was mediated by cortical thickness of the bilateral orbitofrontal region. Taken together, this study suggests that NGAL plays a potential role in the neuropathophysiology of neurocognitive impairments of HIV.'),\n",

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targeting 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been used to localize neuroinflammation. We aimed to use TSPO-PET imaging to evaluate neuroinflammation in PLWH. DESIGN: Twenty-four virologically suppressed PLWH on combined antiretroviral therapy and 13 HIV-negative (HIV-) controls completed TSPO-PET imaging using the radiotracer [C]PBR28. Because of tracer complexity and differing procedures used in previous studies, we employed an expansive methodological approach, using binding potential (BP) and standard uptake value ratio and multiple different reference regions to estimate [C]PBR28 binding. METHODS: [C]PBR28 binding was measured in 30 cortical and subcortical regions and compared between PLWH and HIV- controls. Pearson correlation evaluated the association between [C]PBR28 binding and cognition and clinical measures of HIV. RESULTS: Analyses conducted using multiple reference regions and measures of tracer uptake revealed no significant differences between [C]PBR28 binding in PLWH compared with HIV- controls. In addition, [C]PBR28 binding in PLWH was not significantly associated with clinical measures of HIV or plasma biomarkers of inflammation. [C]PBR28 binding was not significantly elevated in cognitively impaired PLWH compared with unimpaired PLWH, but there were inverse relationships between cognitive performance (executive and global function) and [C]PBR28 binding in PLWH.

We assessed HIV care quality with four national measures adapted for the NH setting.

Cox proportional hazards models calculated the risk of all-cause and HIV/AIDS-related hospitalization by HIV care compliance.

Between 30 March and 20 May 2020, 27 patients with HIV were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Twenty were male, six female and one transgender female; average age was 49 years; 13/27 were Hispanic and 6/27 were African American. All had HIV viral load <200 copies/mL and were on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count range 87 to 1441 cells/microL. Twenty-six of the 27 had common COVID-19 symptoms for one to twenty-eight days and most had other co-morbidities and/or risk factors. Nine of the 27 were hospitalized for one to thirteen days; of those, three lived in a nursing home, six received remdesivir through a clinical trial or emergency use authorization and tolerated it well; eight recovered and one died. Overall, 17% of known Center people had HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, whereas the comparable state-wide prevalence was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight challenges of outpatient and inpatient HIV care in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and present the largest detailed case series to date from the United States on HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, adding to limited global reports. The aggregated clinical findings suggest that the clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 appear consistent with those without HIV. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is more frequent among persons with HIV remains to be determined. More data are needed as we develop our understanding of how HIV and antiretroviral therapy are affected by or have an impact on this pandemic.'),\n",

       "  'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of kidney cells can lead to HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and aggravate the progression of other chronic kidney diseases. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-induced kidney cell injury is needed for effective therapy against HIV-induced kidney disease progression. We have previously shown that the acetylation and activation of key inflammatory regulators, NF-kappaB p65 and STAT3, were increased in HIVAN kidneys. Here, we demonstrate the key role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase in the regulation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 activity in HIVAN. We found that SIRT1 expression was reduced in the glomeruli of human and mouse HIVAN kidneys and that HIV-1 gene expression was associated with reduced SIRT1 expression and increased acetylation of NF-kappaB p65 and STAT3 in cultured podocytes. Interestingly, SIRT1 overexpression, in turn, reduced the expression of negative regulatory factor in podocytes stably expressing HIV-1 proviral genes, which was associated with inactivation of NF-kappaB p65 and a reduction in HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter activity. In vivo, the administration of the small-molecule SIRT1 agonist BF175 or inducible overexpression of SIRT1 specifically in podocytes markedly attenuated albuminuria, kidney lesions, and expression of inflammatory markers in Tg26 mice. Finally, we showed that the reduction in SIRT1 expression by HIV-1 is in part mediated through miR-34a expression. Together, our data provide a new mechanism of SIRT1 regulation and its downstream effects in HIV-1-infected kidney cells and indicate that SIRT1/miR-34a are potential drug targets to treat HIV-related kidney disease.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a potentially life-saving treatment for individuals with HIV and haematological malignancies; challenges include identifying donors and maintaining antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to investigate interventions to expand donor options and to prevent ART interruptions for patients with HIV in need of alloBMT. METHODS: This single-arm, interventional trial took place at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (Baltimore, MD, USA). Individuals with HIV who were at least 18 years of age and referred for alloBMT for a standard clinical indication were eligible. The only exclusion criterion was a history of documented resistance to enfuvirtide. We used post-transplant cyclophosphamide as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to expand donor options and an optimised ART strategy of avoiding pharmacoenhancers and adding subcutaneous enfuvirtide during post-transplant cyclophosphamide and during oral medication intolerance. Our primary outcome was the proportion of participants who maintained ART through day 60 after alloBMT. We measured the HIV latent reservoir using a quantitative viral outgrowth assay. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01836068. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2013, and August 27, 2015, nine patients who were referred for transplant provided consent. Two patients had relapsed malignancy before donor searches were initiated. Seven patients had suitable donors identified (two matched sibling, two matched unrelated, two haploidentical, and one single-antigen mismatched unrelated) and proceeded to alloBMT. All patients maintained ART through day 60 and required ART changes (median 1, range 1-3) in the first 90 days. One patient stopped ART and developed HIV rebound with grade 4 meningoencephalitis at day 146. Among six patients who underwent alloBMT and had longitudinal measurements available, the HIV latent reservoir was not detected post-alloBMT in four patients with more than 95% donor chimerism, consistent with a 2.06-2.54 log10 reduction in the HIV latent reservoir. In the two patients with less than 95% donor chimerism, the HIV latent reservoir remained stable. INTERPRETATION: By using post-transplant cyclophosphamide as GVHD prophylaxis, we successfully expanded alloBMT donor options for patients with HIV. Continuing ART with a regimen that includes enfuvirtide post-alloBMT was safe, but life-threatening viral rebound can occur with ART interruption.

We examined factors associated with frailty and determined whether there were multiple frailty subtypes in older adults with controlled HIV infection. This was a cross-sectional outpatient study in an urban HIV clinic. Twenty-nine clinical indicators were extracted from medical records to compute a Frailty Index (FI) for 389 older (age 50+) PWH (range = 50-93; mean = 61.1, standard deviation = 7.2; 85% men) receiving HIV treatment in Calgary, Canada. We used regressions to identify factors associated with FI values. Latent class analysis was used to identify FI subtypes. Age, employment status, and duration of known HIV infection were the strongest predictors of FI (p's < 0.05). Four FI subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 (severe metabolic dysfunction+polypharmacy) had the highest mean FI (0.30). Subtype 2 (less severe metabolic dysfunction+polypharmacy) and Subtype 3 (lung and liver dysfunction+polypharmacy) had lower but equivalent mean FIs (0.20 for each). Subtype 4 (least severe metabolic dysfunction) had the lowest mean FI (0.13; p's < 0.001). Sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics differed among the subtypes. Individuals with Subtype 1 were older and more frequently unemployed/retired, whereas those with Subtype 3 were more likely to smoke, use crack/cocaine, have heavy alcohol use, and live in temporary/unstable housing. The clinical presentation of frailty in older PWH is heterogeneous. The metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C virus coinfection, cirrhosis, lung disease, and polypharmacy were associated with frailty as were unemployment/retirement, unstable housing, and substance use.\"),\n",

Lung microbial dysbiosis has been shown to contribute to respiratory disease. Methods: 16S-rRNA gene sequencing on the Miseq-platform and qPCR for typical respiratory pathogens were performed on sputum samples collected from 64 PLW-HIV (median blood CD4 count 676 cells/muL) and 38 HIV-negative participants. Finding: Richness and alpha-diversity as well as the relative-abundance (RA) of the major taxa (RA>1%) were similar between both groups. In unweighted-Unifrac ss-diversity, the samples from PLW-HIV showed greater diversity, in contrast to the HIV negative samples which clustered together. Gut bacterial taxa such as Bilophila and members of Enterobacteriaceae as well as pathogenic respiratory taxa (Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were significantly more frequent in PLW-HIV and almost absent in the HIV-negative group. Carriage of these taxa was correlated with the length of time between HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART (Spearman-rho=0.279, p=0.028). Interpretation: Although the core airway microbiome was indistinguishable between PLW-HIV on effective ART and HIV-negative participants, PLW-HIV's respiratory microbiome was enriched with potential respiratory pathogens and gut bacteria. The observed differences in PLW-HIV may be due to HIV infection altering the local lung microenvironment to be more permissive to harbour pathogenic bacteria that could contribute to respiratory comorbidities. Prompt start of ART for PLW-HIV may reduce this risk.\"),\n",

Study Design: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 6 months was used to execute the study. Materials and Methods: Forty-seven subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (n=22 RBAC and n=25 placebo) for 6 months with assessments at baseline and 3 and 6 months. A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance model was used to assess the differences between RBAC and placebo groups in cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure), endothelial function (skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide), and immune (CD4(+) cell count) markers from baseline to 6 months. Results: The effect of treatment (RBAC versus placebo) was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.92, F[3, 102]=3.07, P=0.03). The effect of time was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.10, F[2, 103]=474.6, P<0.001). The overall interaction between treatment and time was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.92, F[2, 103]=4.58, P=0.01). Time contrasts showed that a difference in the overall dependent variable did not occur from baseline to 3 months (F[1, 104]=2.7, P=0.10), marginally occurred from baseline to 6 months (F[1, 104]=3.2, P=0.08), and was significant from 3 to 6 months (F[1, 104]=6.43, P=0.01). Conclusions: The overall significant interaction suggests varying responses in the dependent variables between RBAC and placebo over time, which is being driven by systolic blood pressure, as it decreased in the RBAC group, but increased in the placebo group. In addition, CD4(+) manifested a non-significant increase from baseline to 3 months then decreased from 3 to 6 months in the RBAC group, whereas it decreased at 3 months followed by a slight increase at 6 months in the placebo group. Skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide improved non-significantly overall in both groups, but worsened from 3 to 6 months in the placebo group. Thus, RBAC treatment may contribute to modest short-term improvements in systolic blood pressure, endothelial function, and CD4(+) cell count, which could help improve the overall health profile of HIV(+) adults. Relevance for Patients: Persons with HIV on ART suffer disproportionately from hypertension and endothelial dysfunction compared to the non-infected population, and conventional medical therapy does not alleviate these issues. RBAC is a safe, low-risk alternative that may help to improve the overall quality of life of these patients through modest improvements in these biomarkers plus CD4(+) cell count.\"),\n",

Yet, there is a dearth of evidence-based treatment options that can address both unhealthy alcohol use and comorbidities in SSA HIV care settings. Recent studies testing single-session alcohol brief interventions (BIs) among PLWH in SSA have suggested that more robust treatments are needed. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot randomized controlled superiority trial that will test the effectiveness of an evidence-based transdiagnostic multi-session psychotherapy, the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), compared to a control condition consisting of a single session brief alcohol intervention (BI) based on CETA, at reducing unhealthy alcohol use, mental health problems, and other substance use among PLWH in urban Zambia. Methods: The study is a single-blind, parallel, individually randomized trial conducted in HIV treatment centers in Lusaka. 160 PLWH who meet criteria for unhealthy alcohol use + mental health or substance use comorbidities and/or have a more severe alcohol use disorder are eligible. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive the single-session BI or CETA. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and a six-month follow-up and include unhealthy alcohol use, depression, trauma symptoms, and other substance use. Conclusions: The trial is a first step in establishing the effectiveness of CETA at reducing unhealthy alcohol use and comorbidities among PLWH in SSA.

It can be treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone or with ART plus cytotoxic chemotherapy. ART-treated EpKS can either respond or worsen upon treatment. This study aimed at identifying immunological markers of ART-treatment response. We compared responders (those with clinical EpKS tumor regression) versus poor responders (those with progressive or non-responsive EpKS). We measured plasma cytokine and chemokine levels using cytometric bead assays. Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses were also quantified to test associations with treatment outcome. Interleukin (IL)-5 levels were significantly elevated in responders versus poor-responders at baseline (0.76pg/ml vs. 0.37pg/ml; p<0.01) and follow-up (0.56pg/ml vs. 0.37pg/ml; p<0.01); IL-6 was lower in responders than poor-responders at follow-up (600fg/ml vs. 4272fg/ml; p<0.05). IP-10/CxCL-10 was significantly lower at follow-up in responders versus poor-responders (187pg/ml vs. 528pg/ml; p<0.01). KSHV nAb were not significantly differential between responders and poor-responders. In conclusion, high plasma IL-5 at baseline could be a marker for ART-treated KS tumor regression, whereas increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and the chemokine IP-10, associate with KS tumor progression.\"),\n",

Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the risk of female-to-male transmission of HIV by 50-60%. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) identified 14 priority countries for VMMC campaigns and set a coverage goal of 80% for men ages 15-49. From 2008 to 2017, over 18 million VMMCs were reported in priority countries. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about local variation in male circumcision (MC) prevalence. METHODS: We analyzed geo-located MC prevalence data from 109 household surveys using a Bayesian geostatistical modeling framework to estimate adult MC prevalence and the number of circumcised and uncircumcised men aged 15-49 in 38 countries in sub-Saharan Africa at a 5 x 5-km resolution and among first administrative level (typically provinces or states) and second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. RESULTS: We found striking within-country and between-country variation in MC prevalence; most (12 of 14) priority countries had more than a twofold difference between their first administrative level units with the highest and lowest estimated prevalence in 2017. Although estimated national MC prevalence increased in all priority countries with the onset of VMMC campaigns, seven priority countries contained both subnational areas where estimated MC prevalence increased and areas where estimated MC prevalence decreased after the initiation of VMMC campaigns. In 2017, only three priority countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania) were likely to have reached the MC coverage target of 80% at the national level, and no priority country was likely to have reached this goal in all subnational areas. CONCLUSIONS: Despite MC prevalence increases in all priority countries since the onset of VMMC campaigns in 2008, MC prevalence remains below the 80% coverage target in most subnational areas and is highly variable. These mapped results provide an actionable tool for understanding local needs and informing VMMC interventions for maximum impact in the continued effort towards ending the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.'),\n",

However, some people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced have limited or no treatment options, owing to multidrug resistance(6). In addition, suboptimal adherence to oral daily regimens can negatively affect the outcome of treatment-which contributes to virologic failure, resistance generation and viral transmission-as well as of pre-exposure prophylaxis, leading to new infections(1,2,4,7-9). Long-acting agents from new antiretroviral classes can provide much-needed treatment options for people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced, and additionally can improve adherence(10). Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV.'),\n",

       "  'INTRODUCTION: Surveillance of recent HIV infections in national testing services has the potential to inform primary prevention programming activities. Focusing on procedures required to accurately determine recent infection, and the potential for recent infection surveillance to inform prevention efforts, we present the results of three independent but linked pilots of recency testing. METHODS: To distinguish recently acquired HIV infection from long-standing infection, in 2018 we applied a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm that combined a laboratory-based Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunoassay with clinical information (viral-load; history of prior HIV diagnosis; antiretroviral therapy-exposure). We explored potential misclassification of test results and analysed the characteristics of participants with recent infection. We applied the algorithm in antenatal clinics providing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Siaya County, Kenya, outreach sites serving female sex workers in Zimbabwe, and routine HIV testing and counselling facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. In Nairobi, we also conducted recency testing among partners of HIV-positive participants. RESULTS: In Siaya County, 2.3% (10/426) of HIV-positive pregnant women were classified as recent. A risk factor analysis comparing women testing recent with those testing HIV-negative found women in their first trimester were significantly more likely to test recent than those in their second or third trimester. In Zimbabwe, 10.5% (33/313) of female sex workers testing HIV-positive through the outreach programme were classified recent. A risk factor analysis of women testing recent versus those testing HIV-negative, found no strong evidence of an association with recent infection. In Nairobi, among 532 HIV-positive women and men, 8.6% (46) were classified recent. Among partners of participants, almost a quarter of those who tested HIV-positive were classified as recent (23.8%; 5/21). In all three settings, the inclusion of clinical information helped improve the positive predictive value of recent infection testing by removing cases that were likely misclassified. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified recently acquired infections among persons testing HIV-positive in routine testing settings and highlight the importance of incorporating additional information to accurately classify recent infection. We identified a number of groups with a significantly higher proportion of recent infection, suggesting recent infection surveillance, when rolled-out nationally, may help in further targeting primary prevention efforts.'),\n",

This analysis examines experiences of violence victimization, and the perpetrators of this violence, among AYA living with HIV, aged 15-24 years, in Zambia. METHODS: We analyzed baseline data from 272 AYA (60.1% female, 71.0% perinatally infected) enrolled in Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success), a randomized controlled trial conducted in four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia. Violence measures were adapted from the ICAST-C and the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence. Youth could report up to 12 perpetrator types for past-year experiences of violence. We estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex, disaggregated by sex and age group. Estimates were weighted using sex and age data from the 2013-14 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey to be representative of HIV-positive AYA in Zambia. RESULTS: Estimated lifetime prevalence of any violence victimization was 78.2%. Past-year prevalence was 72.0% among males and 74.5% among females. Almost half of AYA (46.1%) had ever experienced polyvictimization (2+ types of violence). Psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year) and forced sex (10.4% lifetime, 4.7% past-year). Among past-year victims, males experienced more violence than females from a friend/peer (74.3% vs. 45.1%, p<0.001); females experienced more violence than males from a romantic partner (33.3% vs. 5.0%, p<0.001), parent/caregiver (32.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.02), and stranger (19.7% vs. 5.2%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The widespread and overlapping prevalence of multiple types of violence highlights the critical need for prevention and response efforts that are tailored to youths' sex and the perpetrator type. Future research should explore violence victimization and HIV outcomes, and the measurement of psychological abuse and sexual violence, among HIV-positive AYA in the region.\"),\n",

METHODS: Using 2011-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, we estimated the percentage of the state population, plus the District of Columbia, aged 18-64 years ever tested for HIV and tested for HIV in the previous 12 months. The 50 states and the District of Columbia were grouped according to the estimated prevalence of HIV in 2011. We used orthogonal contrasts to calculate P values for linear trends. RESULTS: The percentage of the population ever tested for HIV increased significantly in 23 states during 2011-2017, whereas the percentage tested for HIV in the previous 12 months increased significantly in 8 states. In 2017, the mean percentage ever tested for HIV in states with a high prevalence of HIV was 8.6 percentage points higher than the mean percentage in states with a low prevalence of HIV (48.5% vs 39.9%); the mean increase in the percentage ever tested was highest (11.4%) in states with a low prevalence of HIV.

Live viral vaccines induce antibody responses that last a lifetime, but those induced with subunit vaccines wane rapidly. Studies in mice and humans have established that long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) in the bone marrow (BM) are critical mediators of durable antibody responses. Here, we present data that adjuvanting an HIV-1 clade C 1086.C-derived gp140 immunogen (Env) with a novel synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 agonist named 3M-052 formulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid or PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) or with alum, either alone or in combination with a TLR-4 agonist GLA, induces notably high and persistent (up to ~1 year) frequencies of Env-specific LLPCs in the BM and serum antibody responses in rhesus macaques. Up to 36 and 18% of Env-specific cells among total IgG-secreting BM-resident plasma cells were detected at peak and termination, respectively. In contrast, adjuvanting Env with alum or GLA in NP induced significantly lower (~<100-fold) LLPC and antibody responses. Immune responses induced by 3M-052 were also significantly higher than those induced by a combination of TLR-7/8 (R848) and TLR-4 (MPL) agonists. Adjuvanting Env with 3M-052 also induced robust activation of blood monocytes, strong plasmablast responses in blood, germinal center B cells, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and persistent Env-specific plasma cells in draining lymph nodes. Overall, these results demonstrate efficacy of 3M-052 in promoting high magnitude and durability of antibody responses via robust stimulation of innate immunity and BM-resident LLPCs.'),\n",

Children are tested primarily in outpatient clinics, which show low HIV-positive rates. To demonstrate efficient facility-based HIV testing among children aged 0-14 years, we evaluated pediatric HIV-positivity rates in points of service in select health facilities in Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of HIV testing and case identification among children aged 0-14 years at all points of service at nine purposively sampled hospitals (November 2016-March 2017). Points of service included family index testing, pediatric outpatient department (POPD), tuberculosis (TB) clinics, immunization clinics, and pediatric inpatient ward. Eligibility for testing at POPD was done using a screening tool while all children with unknown status were eligible for HIV test at other points of service. The main outcome was HIV positivity rates stratified by the testing point of service and by age group. Predictors of an HIV-positive result were assessed using logistic regression. All analyses were done using Stata 15 statistical software. RESULTS: Of 2,180 children seen at all facility points of service with unknown HIV status, 1,822 (83.6%) were tested for HIV, of whom 43 (2.4%) tested HIV positive. The numbers of children tested by age group were <1 years = 230 (12.6%); 1-4 years = 752 (41.3%); 5-9 years = 520 (28.5%); and 10-14 years = 320 (17.6%). The number of children tested by point of service were POPD = 906 (49.7%); family index testing = 693 (38.0%); pediatric inpatient ward = 192 (10.5%); immunization clinic = 16 (0.9%); and TB clinic = 15 (0.8%). HIV positivity rates by point of service were TB clinic = 6.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9-35.2%); pediatric inpatient ward = 4.7% (95%CI: 2.5-8.8%); family index testing = 3.5% (95%CI: 2.3-5.1%); POPD = 1.0% (95%CI: 0.5-1.9%); and immunization clinic = 0%. The percentage contribution to total HIV positive children found by point of services was: family index testing = 55.8% (95%CI: 40.9-69.8%); POPD = 20.9% (95%CI: 11.3-35.6%); inpatient ward = 20.9 (95%CI: 11.3-35.6%) and TB Clinic = 2.3% (95%CI: 0.3-14.8%). Compared with the POPD, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for finding an HIV positive child by point of service were TB clinic = 7.2 (95% CI: 0.9-60.9); pediatric inpatient ward = 4.9 (95% CI: 1.9-12.8); and family index testing = 3.7 (95% CI: 1.5-8.8).

The mechanisms of fat alterations in PLWH are complex, multifactorial and not fully understood, although they are known to result in part from the direct effects of HIV proteins and antiretroviral agents on adipocyte health, genetic factors, increased microbial translocation, changes in the adaptive immune milieu after infection, increased tissue inflammation and accelerated fibrosis.

Despite the importance of HIV testing services (HTS) in HIV control, uptake of HTS among female sex workers (FSWs) across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains sub-optimal. Concerns about stigma associated with sex work and fear of loss of livelihood if HIV status becomes known, are some of the restrictions for FSWs to utilize HTS offered through health care facilities. Introduction of HIV self-testing (HIVST) may mitigate some of the barriers for the uptake of HTS. This study explored the acceptability of FSWs towards the introduction of HIVST in Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study employing in-depth interviews (IDI) and participatory group discussions (PGD) with FSWs in selected regions of Tanzania. Study participants were recruited through snowball sampling. Data were thematically analysed by two analysts using NVivo software. The analysis was informed by the social-ecological model and focused on factors associated with the acceptability of HIVST. RESULTS: We conducted 21 PGD sessions involving 227 FSWs. Twenty three IDIs were conducted to complement data collected through PGD. Our study has demonstrated that FSWs are enthusiastic toward HIVST. Convenience (time and cost saved), and belief that HIVST will increase privacy and confidentiality motivated participants' support for the self-testing approach. Participants did express concerns about their ability to interpret and trust the results of the test. Participants also expressed concern that HIVST could cause personal harm, including severe distress and self-harm for individuals with a reactive test. Very likely, concern about adverse effects of HIVST was linked to the study participants' lay perception that HIVST would be provided only through unassisted modality. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs demonstrated high enthusiasm to use the HIVST once it becomes available. Expectations for increased confidentiality, autonomy, and reduced opportunity costs were among the leading factors that attracted FSWs to HIVST. The major obstacles to the acceptability of HIVST included fear of HIV reactive test and not trusting self-diagnoses. Our findings underscore the importance of providing adequate access to counselling and referral services in conjunction with HIVST.\"),\n",

The unique properties of low-voltage-activation, faster inactivation, and slower deactivation of these channels support their role in modulation of cellular excitability and low-threshold firing. Thus, selective T-type calcium channel antagonists are highly sought after. Here, we explored Ugi-azide multicomponent reaction products to identify compounds targeting T-type calcium channel. Of the 46 compounds tested, an analog of benzimidazolonepiperidine-5bk (1-{1-[(R)-{1-[(1S)-1-phenylethyl]-1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl}(thiophen-3-yl)methyl ]piperidin-4-yl}-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-one) modulated depolarization-induced calcium influx in rat sensory neurons. Modulation of T-type calcium channels by 5bk was further confirmed in whole-cell patch clamp assays in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, where pharmacological isolation of T-type currents led to a time- and concentration-dependent regulation with a low micromolar IC50. Lack of an acute effect of 5bk argues against a direct action on T-type channels. Genetic knockdown revealed CaV3.2 to be the isoform preferentially modulated by 5bk. High voltage-gated calcium, as well as tetrodotoxin-sensitive and -resistant sodium, channels were unaffected by 5bk. 5bk inhibited spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and depolarization-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from lumbar spinal cord slices. Notably, 5bk did not bind human mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. 5bk reversed mechanical allodynia in rat models of HIV-associated neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and spinal nerve ligation-induced neuropathy, without effects on locomotion or anxiety.

The Hologic Panther system uses 0.7mL total volume for the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Assay standard (APT-Quant-std) and dilution (APT-Quant-dil) protocols. However, smaller plasma volumes from fingerstick whole blood (FSB) collected in EDTA-microtainer tubes (MCT) could provide an easier sample collection method for HIV-1 VL testing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the APT-Quant-std compared to the Roche CAP/CTM and Abbott m2000RT VL assays and an alternative APTQuant 1:7 dilution protocol, the latter using 100muL of MCT-derived plasma from FSB. STUDY DESIGN: Linearity was determined using commercial HIV-1 RNA plasma controls. Dilutions ranging 1.56-2.95 log10 copies/mL were prepared to determine the APT-Quant-dil Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) using Probit analysis. Specificity of APT-Quant-std was calculated using 326 HIVnegative samples. To evaluate agreement, 329 plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std, CAP/CTM, and m2000RT. Forty-seven matched venipuncture and MCT-derived plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std and APT-Quant-dil. RESULTS: Among the RNA controls, specificity was 99.69 % for APT-Quant-std. The R2 values were 0.988 (APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM), 0.980 (APT-Quant-std/ m2000RT), and 0.997 (APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil). The APT-Quant-dil LOQ was estimated at 2.7 log10 copies/mL (500 copies/mL) (95 %CI 2.62-2.87). At 2.3 log10 copies/mL (200 copies/mL), the overall agreement was 91.0 % for APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM, 85.7 % for APT-Quant-std/m2000RT, and 82.9 % for APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil. Quantified APT-Quant-std results were on average 0.2 log10 copies/mL higher than CAP/CTM and m2000RT and 0.14 log10 copies/mL higher than APT-Quant-dil.

An integrated approach to address these co-occurring conditions in a manner that facilitates treatment utilization would represent an important advance in HIV-care. This study examined the acceptability and feasibility of a tailored, videoconferencing intervention to reduce chronic pain and heavy drinking among PLWHA. Participants in HIV-care (n = 8) completed baseline assessments and an in-person intervention session followed by 6 videoconferencing sessions. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed with patient satisfaction ratings and interview responses 8 weeks following baseline along with videoconferencing use during the intervention period. Treatment satisfaction and comprehensibility ratings were high and supported by interview responses indicating the value of the intervention content, treatment alliance, and format. All participants successfully enabled videoconferencing on their own smartphones and completed a median number of 4.5 (out of 6) video-sessions. Changes in heavy drinking and pain provided additional support for the potential utility of this approach. Results suggest that this videoconferencing intervention is an acceptable and feasible method of addressing chronic pain and heavy drinking among PLWHA.

A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = - 14, y = - 24, z = - 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy.'),\n",

Recent data suggest that these individuals are also at an elevated risk of certain complications post-ASCT. This risk may result from preexisting HIV-related factors affecting dynamics of immune reconstitution post-ASCT. However, to date, there has been little work describing the dynamics of immune reconstitution post-ASCT in persons with HIV and none comparing these data to controls without HIV. METHODS: We assessed T-cell reconstitution in 6 ASCT with HIV recipients (HIV+ASCT) compared to a control population of 21 ASCT without HIV recipients. In a subset of HIV+ASCT recipients we performed additional flow cytometry profiling of CD8+ T-cell subsets and antigen specificity of reconstituting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. RESULTS: We observe no difference in post-ASCT CD4+ T cells between HIV+ASCT and HIV-negative ASCT recipients, despite much lower pre-ASCT CD4+ T-cell counts in the HIV+ASCT group. In contrast, we observed significantly higher CD8+ T-cell numbers in the HIV+ASCT group post-ASCT. The reconstituting CD8+ T-cells were predominantly CD45RO+, whereas homing markers and antigen specificity of these cells varied between participants. CONCLUSION: This study represents the most extensive characterization of immune-reconstitution post-ASCT in persons with HIV, and the first to our knowledge to compare these data to ASCT controls without HIV. The results indicate that immune reconstitution in this group can be affected by preexisting HIV infection and post-ASCT antigen exposure.'),\n",

       "  'HIV-1 group M was transmitted to humans nearly one century ago. The virus has since evolved to form distinct clades, which spread to different regions of the world. The envelope glycoproteins (Envs) of HIV-1 have rapidly diversified in all infected populations. We examined whether key antigenic sites of Env and signatures of vaccine efficacy are evolving toward similar or distinct structural forms in different populations worldwide. Patterns of amino acid variants that emerged at each position of Env were compared between diverse HIV-1 clades and isolates from different geographic regions. Interestingly, at each Env position, the amino acid in the clade ancestral or regional-founder virus was replaced by a unique frequency distribution (FD) of amino acids. FDs are highly conserved in populations from different regions worldwide and in paraphyletic and monophyletic subclade groups. Remarkably, founder effects of Env mutations at the clade and regional levels have gradually decreased during the pandemic by evolution of each site toward the unique combination of variants. Therefore, HIV-1 Env is evolving at a population level toward well-defined \"target\" states; these states are not specific amino acids but rather specific distributions of amino acid frequencies. Our findings reveal the powerful nature of the forces that guide evolution of Env and their conservation across different populations. Such forces have caused a gradual decrease in the interpopulation diversity of Env despite an increasing intrapopulation diversity.IMPORTANCE The Env protein of HIV-1 is the primary target in AIDS vaccine design. Frequent mutations in the virus increase the number of Env forms in each population, limiting the efficacy of AIDS vaccines. Comparison of newly emerging forms in different populations showed that each position of Env is evolving toward a specific combination of amino acids. Similar changes are occurring in different HIV-1 subtypes and geographic regions toward the same position-specific combinations of amino acids, often from distinct ancestral sequences. The predictable nature of HIV-1 Env evolution, as shown here, provides a new framework for designing vaccines that are tailored to the unique combination of variants expected to emerge in each virus subtype and geographic region.'),\n",

Very early-treated children may have higher cure/remission potential. Methods: In an observational study of 151 in utero (IU)-infected infants in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, whose treatment adhered strictly to national guidelines, 76 infants diagnosed via point-of-care (PoC) testing initiated cART at a median of 26 h (IQR 18-38) and 75 infants diagnosed via standard-of-care (SoC) laboratory-based testing initiated cART at 10 days (IQR 8-13). We analysed mortality, time to suppression of viraemia, and maintenance of aviraemia over the first 2 years of life. Findings: Baseline plasma viral loads were low (median 8000 copies per mL), with 12% of infants having undetectable viraemia pre-cART initiation. However, barely one-third (37%) of children achieved suppression of viraemia by 6 months that was maintained to >12 months. 24% had died or were lost to follow up by 6 months. Infant mortality was 9.3%. The high-frequency virological failure in IU-infected infants was associated not with transmitted or acquired drug-resistant mutations but with cART non-adherence (plasma cART undetectable/subtherapeutic, p<0.0001) and with concurrent maternal cART failure (OR 15.0, 95%CI 5.6-39.6; p<0.0001). High-frequency virological failure was observed in PoC- and SoC-tested groups of children. Interpretation: The success of early infant testing and cART initiation strategies is severely limited by subsequent cART non-adherence in HIV-infected children. Although there are practical challenges to administering paediatric cART formulations, these are overcome by mothers who themselves are cART-adherent. These findings point to the ongoing obligation to address the unmet needs of the mothers. Eliminating the particular barriers preventing adequate treatment for these vulnerable women and infants need to be prioritised in order to achieve durable suppression of viraemia on cART, let alone HIV cure/remission, in HIV-infected children.

In total, 1610 pregnant women from three different healthcare settings took part in the study. We captured the results of repeated HIV tests and conducted semi-structured interviews to explore participants' socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior. For HIV incidence rates, we calculated the number of seroconversions per 100 person-years. We used Fisher's exact test to test for potential associations. Penalized maximum likelihood logistic regression and Poisson regression were applied to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: The overall HIV incidence rate among participants was 2.9/100 women-years.

METHODS: We conducted secondary analysis of an end line survey administered under a cluster-randomized trial of community-based distribution of HIVST kits. We estimated prevalence differences and prevalence ratios (PRs) stratified by sex for the outcome: self-reported ever HIVST. RESULTS: Prevalence of ever HIVST was 45.0% (475/1055) among men and 40.1% (584/1456) among women. Age was associated with ever HIVST in both men and women, with evidence of a strong declining trend across categories of age.

METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015 Mozambique Demographic and Health Survey and AIDS Indicator Survey. The analysis performed in four stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights did the following: i) created a complex sample plan file in SPSS, ii) performed the weighted estimate of HIV prevalence, iii) performed complex sample chi-square test of independence, and then iv) performed complex sample logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Out of 11,270 participants, 1,469 (13.0%) tested positive for HIV. The prevalence of HIV infection was higher in females (15.1%) than males (10.2%). We found that urban dwellers were more likely to be HIV-positive compared to rural dwellers (AOR: 1.70; CI: 1.27, 2.27). We observed provincial variations in HIV prevalence, with Maputo Cidade (17.4%), Maputo Provincia (22.6%), Gaza (25.2%) recording higher prevalence above the national estimate. Other independent predictors of HIV infection in Mozambique included age, education level, marital status, total lifetime sexual partners, and having had an STI in the last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed associations between high-risk sexual behavior and HIV infection.

Secondary distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits-wherein patients deliver kits to partners-is a novel strategy to increase HIV testing access. Using quantitative data, we assessed willingness to distribute HIVST kits to recent sex partners among a U.S. national sample of HIV-negative SMM (n = 786). A thematic analysis was then conducted to identify barriers and facilitators of kit distribution to partners among young SMM (M age = 25.75 years; range: 20-29; n = 165). Overall, 93.5% of SMM (and 97.0% of young SMM) were willing to deliver HIVST kits to recent sex partners. Among young SMM, main barriers and facilitators included concerns about their partners' reaction, availability and cost, protection beliefs for others, HIV stigma and perceived infidelity, packaging and support, communication skill needs, inability to contact partners, requests for anonymity, and dyadic self-testing with their partners. The findings highlight the need for supportive intervention strategies such as informational content for HIVST, using motivational interviewing when providing the testing kits to index clients and providing skills-based training through role-playing exercises. Secondary distribution of HIVST kits through index patients is a potentially acceptable approach that could be used to expand access to HIV testing and aid in efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S.\"),\n",

Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed >/= 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed >/= 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to >/= 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group.

Traditionally, various community and health care organizations have worked to address different stages of PrEP or TasP care. OBJECTIVE: To understand the importance of how HIV prevention organizations providing these services interact to provide the comprehensive care needed for successful HIV and PrEP continuum outcomes. DESIGN: Utilizing an Organizational Network Survey, network ties were examined between formal and informal partnerships among community agencies. SETTING: This study examined community agencies in the current HIV prevention system in Chicago. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two community agencies across the Chicago metropolitan area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using network analysis, this study examined ties between community agencies and assessed perceptions of collaboration and competitiveness in the current HIV prevention system in Chicago. RESULTS: Overall, respondents reported that the current environment of HIV prevention in Chicago was extremely (18.8%), moderately (37.5%), or somewhat collaborative (37.5%) and extremely (68.8%) or moderately competitive (25.0%). The majority of partnerships reported were informal, with less than a quarter being formalized. That said, those who reported formal partnerships reported being satisfied with those relationships. There was a significantly negative association between density and perceived collaboration-grantees experiencing a more collaborative also reported less dense networks. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that, despite perceived competitiveness, agencies are willing to work together and create a cohesive HIV prevention and treatment system. However, more work should be done to foster an environment that can support the formation of partnerships, to improve a coordinated response to providing HIV care, and sustain mutually beneficial relationships.'),\n",

We examined whether internalized stigma and enacted HIV stigma are associated with three indicators of substance use among PLWH, including numbers of (1) substances used, (2) substances used at moderate to high risk, and (3) times substances were used before sex, through the mediator of depressive symptoms. Participants included 358 PLWH aged 18-35 years from Georgia, United States. At baseline, participants completed measures of internalized and enacted stigma, depressive symptoms, and substance use severity. Substance use was additionally tested with urinalysis. Following baseline, participants reported their use of substances before sex for 28 days through daily text messaging. Data were analyzed using path analysis in R. On average, participants tested positive for 1.24 (range: 0-6) substances used, reported moderate to high risk on 2.01 (range: 0-8) substances, and reported using substances 1.57 (range: 0-20) times before sex over 28 days. Internalized stigma and enacted stigma were associated with greater depressive symptoms, and depressive symptoms were associated with all three indicators of substance use. Moreover, the indirect effects between internalized and enacted stigma with indicators of substance use were significant, suggesting that depressive symptoms partially mediated associations between stigma and substance use. Interventions may be needed to address both stigma and depressive symptoms among PLWH to reduce substance use and support HIV treatment and prevention efforts.'),\n",

We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies of the association of peripheral blood immune markers with neurocognitive performance in ART experienced HIV-positive participants. Thirty-seven studies were eligible, including 12 longitudinal studies and 25 cross-sectional studies. Findings consistently show that HIV-positive participants have altered immune marker levels, including elevated markers of monocyte activation (neopterin, sCD14, sCD163) and inflammation (CCL2, IL-8, IL-18, IP-10, IFN-alpha, sTNFR-II and TNF-alpha). These elevated levels persist in HIV-positive participants despite ART. The majority of studies found associations of HANI with immune markers, including those linked to monocyte activation (sCD14 and sCD163) and inflammation (IL-18 and IP-10). Despite the heterogeneity of studies reviewed, due to the presence of raised peripheral markers, our narrative review provides evidence of chronic inflammation despite ART.

Changes in national HIV workforce policies, health facility practices, and provider experiences were examined in rural Malawi and Tanzania between 2013 and 2017. In both countries, task-shifting and task-sharing policies were explicit by 2013. In facilities, the cadre mix of providers varied by site and changed over time, with a higher and growing proportion of lower cadre staff in the Malawi site. In Malawi, the introduction of lay counsellors was perceived to have eased the workload of other providers, but lay counsellors reported inadequate support. Both countries had guidance on the minimum numbers of personnel required to deliver HIV services. However, patient loads per provider increased in both settings for HIV tests and visits by ART patients and were not met with corresponding increases in provider capacity in either setting. Providers reported this as a challenge. Although increasing patient numbers bodes well for achieving universal antiretroviral therapy coverage, the quality of care may be undermined by increased workloads and insufficient provider training. Task-shifting strategies may help address workload concerns, but require careful monitoring, supervision and mentoring to ensure effective implementation.'),\n",

As such inhibitors are transition-state mimics, a detailed understanding of the enzyme mechanism is crucial for the development of better anti-HIV drugs. Here, we used room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron crystallography to directly visualize hydrogen atoms and map hydrogen bonding interactions in a protease complex with peptidomimetic inhibitor KVS-1 containing a reactive nonhydrolyzable ketomethylene isostere, which, upon reacting with the catalytic water molecule, is converted into a tetrahedral intermediate state, KVS-1TI. We unambiguously determined that the resulting tetrahedral intermediate is an oxyanion, rather than the gem-diol, and both catalytic aspartic acid residues are protonated. The oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate appears to be unstable, even though the negative charge on the oxyanion is delocalized through a strong n --> pi* hyperconjugative interaction into the nearby peptidic carbonyl group of the inhibitor. To better understand the influence of the ketomethylene isostere as a protease inhibitor, we have also examined the protease structure and binding affinity with keto-darunavir (keto-DRV), which similar to KVS-1 includes the ketomethylene isostere. We show that keto-DRV is a significantly less potent protease inhibitor than DRV. These findings shed light on the reaction mechanism of peptide hydrolysis catalyzed by HIV-1 protease and provide valuable insights into further improvements in the design of protease inhibitors.'),\n",

We sought to assess the uptake, yield and cost-effectiveness of testing for latent and active TB. METHODS: Adults attending an ambulatory HIV clinic in London, UK were prospectively recruited by stratified selection and tested for TB infection using symptom questionnaires, chest radiograph (CXR), tuberculin skin test (TST), T-Spot.TB and induced sputum. From this, 30 testing strategies were compared in a cost-effectiveness model including probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: 219 subjects were assessed; 95% were using antiretroviral therapy (ART). Smear negative, culture positive TB was present in 0.9% asymptomatic subjects, LTBI in 9%. Only strategies testing those from subSaharan Africa with a TST or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) with or without CXR, or testing those from countries with a TB incidence of >40/100,000 with TST alone were cost-effective using a pound30,000/QALY threshold.

To facilitate biopharmaceutical production, it is necessary to produce these in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, the cellular substrate used for the manufacturing of most recombinant protein therapeutics. However, previous studies have shown that when recombinant Env proteins from clade B viruses, the major subtype represented in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, are expressed in CHO cells, they are proteolyzed and lack important glycan-dependent epitopes present on virions. Previously, we identified C1s, a serine protease in the complement pathway, as the endogenous CHO protease responsible for the cleavage of clade B laboratory isolates of -recombinant gp120s (rgp120s) expressed in stable CHO-S cell lines. In this paper, we describe the development of two novel CHOK1 cell lines with the C1s gene inactivated by gene editing, that are suitable for the production of any protein susceptible to C1s proteolysis. One cell line, C1s-/- CHOK1 2.E7, contains a deletion in the C1s gene. The other cell line, C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1, contains a deletion in both the C1s gene and the MGAT1 gene, which limits glycosylation to mannose-5 or earlier intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. In addition, we compare the substrate specificity of C1s with thrombin on the cleavage of both rgp120 and human Factor VIII, two recombinant proteins known to undergo unintended proteolysis (clipping) when expressed in CHO cells. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and practicality of the C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1 cell line for the expression of clinical isolates of clade B Envs from rare individuals that possess broadly neutralizing antibodies and are able to control virus replication without anti-retroviral drugs (elite neutralizer/controller phenotypes).

These illnesses are a common cause of ill health in the general population and any increase in their frequency or severity in PLW-HIV might have significant implications for health-related quality of life and the development of chronic respiratory disease. METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study following PLW-HIV and HIV negative participants for 12 months with weekly documentation of any acute respiratory illness, we compared the frequency, severity and healthcare use associated with acute respiratory illnesses to determine whether PLW-HIV continue to have a greater frequency or severity of such illnesses despite antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: We followed-up 136 HIV positive and 73 HIV negative participants for 12 months with weekly documentation of any new respiratory symptoms. We found that HIV status did not affect the frequency of acute respiratory illness: unadjusted incidence rates per person year of follow-up were 2.08 illnesses (95% CI 1.81-2.38) and 2.30 illnesses (1.94-2.70) in HIV positive and negative participants respectively, IRR 0.87 (0.70-1.07) p = 0.18. However, when acute respiratory illnesses occurred, PLW-HIV reported more severe symptoms (relative fold-change in symptom score 1.61 (1.28-2.02), p <0.001) and were more likely to seek healthcare advice (42% vs 18% of illnesses, odds ratio 3.32 (1.48-7.39), p = 0.003). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PLW-HIV still had higher symptom scores when unwell. CONCLUSIONS: HIV suppression with antiretroviral therapy reduces the frequency of acute respiratory illness to background levels, however when these occur, they are associated with more severe self-reported symptoms and greater healthcare utilisation. Exploration of the reasons for this greater severity of acute respiratory illness may allow targeted interventions to improve the health of people living with HIV.

We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question. RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2% of men had never tested compared with 16.5% of women (p < 0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age.

Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1% vs 15.3%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR = 3.74; 95%CI: 1.39-10.03, p < 0.009]), and being >/=25 years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p < 0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR = 3.74; 95%CI: 1.39-10.03, p < 0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up. Programmes introducing, or planning to introduce, HIVST should consider including relevant questions in population-based surveys.'),\n",

The Last Gift is a rapid autopsy research study at the University of California San Diego that enrolls terminally ill people living with HIV (PLWHIV) with a desire to contribute to HIV cure-related research. We conducted in-depth baseline and follow-up interviews with Last Gift study participants. We analyzed interview data applying conventional content analysis. Since summer 2017, 13 participants have been enrolled (n = 11 males and 2 females; aged 45-89 years) and 8 participants interviewed. Terminal illnesses included cancers, heart diseases, and neurodegenerative illnesses. Our analysis revealed five key themes: (1) The Last Gift study has tremendous meaning for participants at the end of their life. (2) HIV-specific altruism was a primary motivator to join the Last Gift study, nested within the context of community, scientific advancement, and moral obligation. (3) Participants did not expect physical benefits yet they perceived emotional/psychological, financial, and societal/scientific benefits. (4) There were minimal participant-perceived risks and concerns. (5) Last Gift participants expressed immense gratitude toward study staff. The Last Gift study provides a framework for ethical HIV cure-related research at EOL and highlighted participants' perspectives, motivations, and experiences. Knowing how PLWHIV understand and experience such studies will remain critical to designing ethical, fully informed HIV cure research protocols that are acceptable to PLWHIV.\"),\n",

       "  \"PURPOSE: After years of stable or declining HIV prevalence and declining incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, some rapidly emerging outbreaks have recently occurred in new areas (e.g., Scott County, Indiana). However, to our knowledge, trends over time in HIV prevalence among PWID in US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) across all major regions of the country have not been systematically estimated beyond 2002, and the extent to which HIV prevalence may be increasing in other areas is largely unknown. This article estimates HIV prevalence among PWID in 89 of the most populated US MSAs, both overall and by geographic region, using more recent surveillance and HIV testing data. METHODS: We computed MSA-specific annual estimates of HIV prevalence (both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections) among PWID for these 89 MSAs, for 1992-2013, using several data series from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National HIV Surveillance System and National HIV Prevention Monitoring and Evaluation data; Holmberg's (1997) estimates of 1992 PWID population size and of HIV prevalence and incidence among PWID; and research estimates from published literature using 1992-2013 data. A mixed effects model, with time nested within MSAs, was used to regress the literature review estimates on all of the other data series. Multiple imputation was used to address missing data. Resulting estimates were validated using previous 1992-2002 estimates of HIV prevalence and data on antiretroviral (ARV) prescription volumes and examined for patterns based on geographic region, numbers of people tested for HIV, and baseline HIV prevalence. RESULTS: Mean (across all MSAs) trends over time suggested decreases through 2002 (from approximately 11.4% in 1992 to 9.2% in 2002), followed by a period of stability, and steep increases after 2010 (to 10.6% in 2013). Validation analyses found a moderate positive correlation between our estimates and ARV prescription volumes (r = 0.45), and a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.94) between our estimates and previous estimates by Tempalski et al. (2009) for 1992-2002 (which used different methods). Analysis by region and baseline prevalence suggested that mean increases in later years were largely driven by MSAs in the Western United States and by MSAs in the Midwest that had low baseline prevalence. Our estimates suggest that prevalence decreased across all years in the Eastern United States. These trends were particularly clear when MSAs with very low numbers of people tested for HIV were removed from analyses to reduce unexplained variability in mean trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest a fairly large degree of variation in 1992-2013 trajectories of PWID HIV prevalence among 89 US MSAs, particularly by geographic region. They suggest that public health responses in many MSAs (particularly those with larger HIV prevalence among PWID in the early 1990s) were sufficient to decrease or maintain HIV prevalence over time. However, future research should investigate potential factors driving the estimated increase in prevalence after 2002 MSAs in the West and Midwest. These findings have potentially important implications for program and/or policy decisions, but estimates for MSAs with low HIV testing denominators should be interpreted with caution and verified locally before planning action.\"),\n",

The SPH and REN consumers were enrolled longer and received more services, compared with HPA consumers. Long-term SPH and REN consumers had better engagement in care, viral suppression, and CD4 count than controls at both first and second year after enrollment, but the effect did not grow bigger from year 1 to 2.

The HIV-1 gp41-derived antigens anchored in the virosome membrane, along with the adjuvant 3M-052 (TLR7/8 agonist) on the same particle, served as a candidate vaccine for the proof of concept for establishing manufacturing processes, which can be directly applied or adapted to other virosomal vaccines or lipid-based particles. Heat spray-dried powders suitable for nasal or oral delivery, and freeze-dried sublingual tablets were successfully developed as solid dosage forms for mucosal vaccination. The antigenic properties of vaccinal antigens with key gp41 epitopes were maintained, preserving the original immunogenicity of the starting liquid form, and also when solid forms were exposed to high temperature (40 degrees C) for up to 3 months, with minimal antigen and adjuvant content variation. Virosomes reconstituted from the powder forms remained as free particles with similar size, virosome uptake by antigen-presenting cells in vitro was comparable to virosomes from the liquid form, and the presence of excipients specific to each solid form did not prevent virosome transport to the draining lymph nodes of immunized mice. Virosome integrity was also preserved during exposure to <-15 degrees C, mimicking accidental freezing conditions. These \"ready to use and all-in-one\" thermostable needle-free virosomal HIV-1 mucosal vaccines offer the advantage of simplified logistics with a lower dependence on the cold chain during shipments and distribution.'),\n",

They are therefore an important population for HIV prevention globally. Despite very low HIV testing coverage among MWPS in many countries, the role of HIV self-testing to increase testing coverage has not been explored. We, therefore, conducted a pilot intervention study to evaluate the uptake and acceptability of assisted and unassisted HIV self-testing among MWPS in Indonesia. METHODS: MWPS attending seven brothels in Bali between December 2017 and January 2018 were recruited by lay health providers to participate in a brief health survey, and then invited to have a HIV self-test (assisted or unassisted) with an OraQuick(R) ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test and complete a post-test acceptability survey. RESULTS: A total of 292 men completed the health survey (response rate: 70%) and 188 (64.6%) accepted HIV self-testing. Of these men, 13.3% had ever tested for HIV and 58.9% reported condom use at their last sexual encounter with a brothel-based female sex worker. Nearly all men (98.9%) who accepted a HIV self-test preferred assisted HIV self-testing - of whom 83.9% preferred to be fully assisted and 16.1% opted to be partially assisted and read their results privately. Of the men who accepted the test and showed the result to the lay health providers, 4 (2.1%) received reactive results. Linkage following HIV self-test is a concern, as none of the four men with a reactive result attended HIV testing at the recommended referral HIV testing clinic over a two-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to investigate the acceptance of HIV self-testing when offered to MWPS in brothels by lay health providers. The high uptake of HIV self-testing suggests that this testing model is acceptable and could increase the very low HIV testing coverage among MWPS. The strong preference for fully assisted HIV self-testing highlights the importance of involving lay health providers in future testing programs. When scaling up HIV self-testing programmatically, strategies to improve linkage-to-care should be considered and evaluated.'),\n",

Home-based HIV couple testing during the antenatal period is a safe and effective method that has been used to test male partners of pregnant women. The goal of this qualitative study was to identify elements that made couple testing successful and describe important characteristics of this home-based intervention from couples' perspectives. METHODS: Couples who received scheduled home-based couple testing during pregnancy in Kisumu, Kenya, were purposively sampled based on HIV status from January to May 2015. An interviewer administered all of the in-depth interviews and two coders were directly involved in the data analysis and reconciled codes several times in the process. RESULTS: Twenty-one couples were enrolled: 9 concordant HIV-negative couples, 8 HIV discordant couples, 3 HIV concordant HIV-positive couples, and 1 whose concordance status was unknown. Median age at the time of home-based couple testing was 24 and 28 years for women and men, respectively. Median relationship duration was 3 years and couples had a median of two pregnancies. The major themes that emerged were that home-based couple testing 1) removed the female burden of requesting couple testing, 2) overcame logistical barriers associated with clinic-based testing, 3) encouraged participants to overcome their fear of testing and disclosure, 4) provided privacy in the home, and 5) provided quality time with the health advisors. Importantly, some women appreciated individual testing at the clinic before couple testing and some couples preferred skilled, anonymous health advisors delivering the intervention rather than known community health workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this qualitative study suggest that home-based couple testing during pregnancy overcame many of the barriers that limit men's access to and uptake of clinic-based testing. It encouraged participants to overcome their fear of testing and disclosure through a setting that afforded privacy and quality time with skilled health advisors. These qualitative results may help design effective partner and couple HIV testing programs in the antenatal setting and alongside or within other assisted partner notification services.

METHODS: Current and former FSWs living with HIV and enrolled in a prospective cohort study in Mombasa, Kenya, were followed monthly to ascertain sexual behavior and underwent quarterly pregnancy testing. Pregnancies were considered planned, mistimed, or unwanted according to fertility desires and pregnancy intentions. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of the association between characteristics and incident pregnancy. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-nine FSWs were eligible (October 2012-April 2017). Most women had a nonpaying, regular partner (83.2%, 232/279), were not using modern nonbarrier contraception (69.5%, 194/279), and did not desire additional children (70.6%, 197/279). Of 34 first incident pregnancies [5.8/100 person-years (p-y); 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1 to 8.0], 91.2% (n = 31) were unintended. The incidences of planned (5.7/100 p-y, n = 3), mistimed (10.4/100 p-y, n = 9), and unwanted pregnancies (4.9/100 p-y, n = 22) were similar (P = 0.15). In univariable analysis, oral contraceptive pill use (versus no contraception), having a nonpaying, regular partner, transactional sex, vaginal washing, condomless sex, and higher sex frequency were associated with an increased pregnancy risk. Older age was associated with a lower pregnancy risk. In multivariable analysis, having a nonpaying, regular partner (adjusted HR 4.0, 95% CI: 1.2 to 14.1) and age >/=40 years (aHR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.9) remained significantly associated with a higher and lower pregnancy risk, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of HIV-positive FSWs, most pregnancies were unintended.

Evidence in animal models have shown that markers of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation vary over the course of the day and are affected by food intake and circadian rhythms. However, daily variations of these markers are not characterized yet in PLWH. Herein, we assessed the variation of these markers over 24 h in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a well-controlled environment. METHODS: As in Canada, PLWH are predominantly men and the majority of them are now over 50 years old, we selected 11 men over 50 receiving ART with undetectable viremia for more than 3 years in this pilot study. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over 24 h before snacks/meals from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 the next day. All participants consumed similar meals at set times, and had a comparable amount of sleep, physical exercise and light exposure. Plasma levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fungal (1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan (BDG) translocation markers, along with markers of intestinal damage fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and regenerating islet-derived protein-3alpha (REG3alpha) were assessed by ELISA or the fungitell assay. RESULTS: Participants had a median age of 57 years old (range 50 to 63). Plasma levels of BDG and REG3alpha did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In contrast, a significant increase of LPS was detected between 12:00 and 16:00 (Z-score: - 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.16 +/- 0.15, p = 0.02), and between 12:00 and 24:00 (- 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.89 +/- 0.26, p < 0.001). The plasma levels of I-FABP at 16:00 (- 0.92 +/- 0.09) were also significantly lower, compared to 8:00 the first day (0.48 +/- 0.26, p = 0.002), 4:00 (0.73 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001) or 8:00 on secondary day (0.88 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Conversely to the fungal translocation marker BDG and the gut damage marker REG3alpha, time of blood collection matters for the proper evaluation for LPS and I-FABP as markers for the risk of inflammatory non-AIDS co-morbidities.

This study extends previous research by examining confidence in the U = U message and potential covariates of confidence in U = U, as well as by assessing the perceived personal risk and sexual outcomes in a sample of people living with HIV (PLWH) in Australia. Between October 2017 and June 2018, 139 adult PLWH were recruited through clinics or community-based strategies. They completed an online questionnaire assessing participant characteristics, general agreement with the U = U message, confidence in U = U as an effective HIV prevention strategy, perceived personal risk of onward transmission, and sexual outcomes. While the majority of participants (70.5%) agreed with the general U = U message, only 48.2% were confident in U = U as an effective HIV transmission prevention strategy across sexual situations. Lack of confidence in U = U was more pronounced in the community subsample, minority group participants, and lower educated participants. A minority of PLWH with self-reported UDVL thought they could pass on HIV and indicated poor sexual outcomes, including sexual inactivity, reduced frequency of sex, and reduced sexual satisfaction. General agreement with the U = U message among PLWH may mask lack of confidence in U = U. Community-based information and education tailored to culturally diverse groups and people with low health literacy are required to promote accurate perception of risk of transmission of HIV with consistent UDVL.'),\n",

Results: HIV enhances susceptibility to opportunistic eye infections, has direct pathogenic effects, and places patients at risk of immune recovery inflammatory syndromes in previously infected eyes after starting highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Widespread availability of HAART has resulted in a decrease of infectious ocular conditions such as cytomegalovirus retinitis, toxoplasmic retinitis, squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and microvascular retinopathy. However, large coexisting burdens of tuberculosis, herpesvirus infection and syphilis (among others) continue to contribute to the burden of ocular disease, especially in low-resource settings. Growing risks of cataract, retinopathy and retinal nerve fiber thinning can affect patients with chronic HIV on HAART; thought due to chronic inflammation and immune activation. Conclusion: The changing epidemic of ocular disease in HIV-infected patients warrants close monitoring and identification of interventions that can help reduce the imminent burden of disease.'),\n",

Objectives: To: (i) estimate the prevalence and trends in overweight/obesity by duration of exposure to ART among recipients, (ii) assess changes in BMI categories among ART recipients between their first clinic visit (BMI-1) and their last clinic visit (BMI-2), (iii) identify ART regimen that predicts overweight/obesity better than the others and factors associated with BMI changes among ART recipients. Methods: A 12-year retrospective record-based review was conducted. Potential predictors of BMI change among patients after at least three years of ART exposure were examined using a multiple logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. ART regimens, duration of exposure to ART, and recipients' demographic and biomedical characteristics including the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus-related comorbidities (DRC), defined as any morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes as described in the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10-CM) codebook index, were investigated as potential predictors of overweight/obesity. Results: Twenty-nine percent of recipients were overweight, 16.6% had obesity of whom 2.4% were morbidly-obese at the last clinic visit. Overweight/obese recipients were more likely to be female, to have DRC and less likely to have CD4 count between 201 and 249 cells/mm(3). Neither the first-line nor the second-, third-line ART regimens predicted overweight/obesity better than the other and neither did the duration of exposure to ART. No significant linear trends were observed in the prevalence of overweight/obesity by the duration of exposure to ART. Conclusion: These results suggest that the ART regimens studied have a comparable effect on overweight/obesity and that the duration of exposure does not affect the outcome. This study calls for further research to elucidate the relative contribution of various factors to BMI change among recipients, including ART regimens.\"),\n",

The Ugandan epidemic is primarily composed of two subtypes, A1 and D, that have been co-circulating for 50 years, frequently recombining in dually infected patients. Here, we investigate the frequency of recombinants in this population and the location of breakpoints along the genome. As part of the PANGEA-HIV consortium, 1,472 consensus genome sequences over 5 kb have been obtained from 1,857 samples collected by the MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Research unit in Uganda, 465 (31.6 per cent) of which were near full-length sequences (>8 kb). Using the subtyping tool SCUEAL, we find that of the near full-length dataset, 233 (50.1 per cent) genomes contained only one subtype, 30.8 per cent A1 (n = 143), 17.6 per cent D (n = 82), and 1.7 per cent C (n = 8), while 49.9 per cent (n = 232) contained more than one subtype (including A1/D (n = 164), A1/C (n = 13), C/D (n = 9); A1/C/D (n = 13), and 33 complex types). K-means clustering of the recombinant A1/D genomes revealed a section of envelope (C2gp120-TMgp41) is often inherited intact, whilst a generalized linear model was used to demonstrate significantly fewer breakpoints in the gag-pol and envelope C2-TM regions compared with accessory gene regions. Despite similar recombination patterns in many recombinants, no clearly supported circulating recombinant form (CRF) was found, there was limited evidence of the transmission of breakpoints, and the vast majority (153/164; 93 per cent) of the A1/D recombinants appear to be unique recombinant forms. Thus, recombination is pervasive with clear biases in breakpoint location, but CRFs are not a significant feature, characteristic of a complex, and diverse epidemic.'),\n",

Data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL), including 39 cognitively normal individuals (aged 60-74 years), 7 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (aged 64-71 years), and 11 individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) (aged 55-74 years), were used as reference. Apart from more women, the AIBL cohort was demographically comparable with the HIV sample. Also, the AIBL PET data did not differ by sex. Cerebellum standardized uptake value ratio amyloid values within 22 regions of interest were estimated. In the HIV sample, apolipoprotein E (APOE) was available in 80%, CSF biomarkers in 60%, and 8-10 years of long-term health outcomes in 100%. RESULTS: HAND and the AIBL group with no cognitive deficits had similar amyloid deposition, which was lower than that in both the MCI and AD groups. At the individual level, one HAND case showed high amyloid deposition consistent with AD. This case also had a CSF-AD-like profile and an E4/E4 for APOE. Clinically, this case declined over 18 years with mild HAND symptoms first, followed by progressive memory decline 8-9 years after the study PET, then progression to severe dementia within 2-3 years, and lived a further 6 years. Another HAND case showed increased amyloid deposition restricted to the hippocampi. Two other HAND cases showed abnormally decreased amyloid in subcortical areas. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to cognitively normal older controls, brain amyloid burden does not differ in virally suppressed HAND at the group level.

At baseline, the ART-Y group had lower BMI and fat mass than the Nref group. Within 12 months of ART initiation, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) had decreased at the lumbar spine and at the whole body less head, despite increased weight, and hip aBMD had not increased in line with the Nref group. There was no evidence of further bone changes between 12 and 24 months. By 24 months, the ART-Y women had gained weight and fat mass, but remained lighter with less fat than the Nref women. ART initiation normalized the low serum albumin of the ART-Y group at baseline, but was associated with elevated bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months. Vitamin D status and renal phosphate handling were normal. ART-N had similar aBMD and other characteristics to the Nref group throughout, except unlike the Nref group, weight and fat mass did not increase and serum albumin decreased. This study in African women of childbearing age demonstrated that the bone loss that had occurred in these PWH after ART initiation did not continue after 12 months and that bone loss did not occur in ART-unexposed PWH over 2 years. At 24 months, despite gains in weight and fat mass, ART-exposed women remained lighter, with lower aBMD, fat mass, and higher bone turnover than women without HIV. More studies are required to establish if the bone loss and fat gain reverse, stabilize, or continue with further ART exposure, particularly during and after menopause. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Tanzania has a high burden of both HIV and cervical cancer, with an HIV prevalence of 5.5% in women in 2018, and a cervical cancer incidence rate among the highest globally, at 59.1 per 100,000 per year, and an estimated 9,772 cervical cancers diagnosed in 2018. We aimed to quantify the impact that interventions intended to control HIV have had and will have on cervical cancer in Tanzania over a period from 1995 to 2070. METHODS: A deterministic transmission-dynamic compartment model of HIV and HPV infection and natural history was used to simulate the impact of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and targeted pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on cervical cancer incidence and mortality from 1995-2070. FINDINGS: We estimate that VMMC has prevented 2,843 cervical cancer cases and 1,039 cervical cancer deaths from 1995-2020; by 2070 we predict that VMMC will have lowered cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates by 28% (55.11 cases per 100,000 women in 2070 without VMMC, compared to 39.93 with VMMC only) and 26% (37.31 deaths per 100,000 women in 2070 without VMMC compared to 27.72 with VMMC), respectively. We predict that ART will temporarily increase cervical cancer diagnoses and deaths, due to the removal of HIV death as a competing risk, but will ultimately further lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates by 7% (to 37.31 cases per 100,000 women in 2070) and 5% (to 26.44 deaths per 100,000 women in 2070), respectively, relative to a scenario with VMMC but no ART. A combination of ART and targeted PrEP use is anticipated to lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates to 35.82 and 25.35 cases and deaths, respectively, per 100,000 women in 2070. CONCLUSIONS: HIV treatment and control measures in Tanzania will result in long-term reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Although, in the near term, the life-extending capability of ART will result in a temporary increase in cervical cancer rates, continued efforts towards HIV prevention will reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality over the longer term. These findings are critical background to understanding the longer-term impact of achieving cervical cancer elimination targets in Tanzania.'),\n",

WHO publishes guidelines on HIV testing strategies that maximise the likelihood of correctly determining one's HIV status. A review of national HIV testing policies in 2014 found low adherence to WHO guidelines. We updated this review to determine adherence to current recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive policy review through April 2018. We extracted data on HIV testing strategies, recommendations on HIV retesting prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related HIV testing information. Descriptive analyses disaggregated by region were conducted to ascertain adherence to recommendations and to describe testing strategy characteristics. RESULTS: Of 91 policies included, 26% (n=24/91) adhered to WHO recommendations. Having a two-assay testing strategy to rule-in HIV infection as opposed to the recommended three-assay testing strategy was a major reason for non-adherence. Of 72 country policies providing sufficient information, 31% (n=22) recommended retesting for HIV prior to initiating ART. Of 25 countries and two regions reporting PrEP-related HIV testing guidelines, almost all recommended testing prior to initiating PrEP and every 3 months during PrEP use. CONCLUSIONS: Global adherence to WHO recommendations for HIV testing strategies have improved since 2014 but remain low. We found adherence existed on a continuum. Such a system provides insights into how countries can move towards adherence by making relatively minor changes to testing strategies. Guidance from WHO on the role of new HIV testing technologies within testing algorithms and identifying ways to simplify testing guidance is warranted.\"),\n",

However, many HIV-positive women who interface with the health system continue to miss out on this information. We sought to: a) determine the proportion of HIV-positive women enrolled in HIV care who missed family planning (FP) counselling; and b) assess if any association existed between receipt of FP counselling and current use of modern contraception to inform programming. METHODS: Data were drawn from a quantitative national cross-sectional survey of 5198 HIV-positive women receiving HIV care at 245 HIV clinics in Uganda; conducted between August and November 2016. Family planning counselling was defined as provision of FP information (i.e. available FP methods and choices) to an HIV-positive woman by a health provider during ANC, at the time of delivery or at the PNC visit. Analyses on receipt of FP counselling were done on 2760 HIV-positive women aged 15-49 years who were not currently pregnant and did not intend to have children in the future. We used a modified Poisson regression model to determine the Prevalence Ratio (PR) as a measure of association between receipt of any FP counselling and current use of modern contraception, controlling for potential confounders. Analyses were performed using STATA statistical software, version 14.1. RESULTS: Overall, 2104 (76.2%) HIV-positive women reported that they received FP counselling at any of the three critical time-points. Of the 24% (n = 656) who did not, 37.9% missed FP counselling at ANC; 41% missed FP counselling during delivery; while 54% missed FP counselling at the post-natal care visit. HIV-positive women who received any FP counselling were significantly more likely to report current use of modern contraception than those who did not (adjusted PR [adj. PR] = 1.21; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.10, 1.33). CONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of HIV-positive women did not receive any form of FP counselling when they interfaced with the healthcare system. This presents a missed opportunity for prevention of unintended pregnancies, and suggests a need for the integration of FP counselling into HIV care at all critical time-points.'),\n",

Perceptions of risks and benefits toward HIV virologic control strategies may be different based on an individual's age due to differing experiences of the impacts of the domestic HIV epidemic, altruistic attitudes toward research participation, and general levels of engagement in health care. We examined preferences of HIV virologic control strategies by age groups. In 2018, we conducted a nationwide, online cross-sectional survey to examine differences in HIV virologic control strategies among a sample of people living with HIV who were <50 and >/=50 years of age. From a total of 281 participants, 3 findings were noteworthy: (1) Participants <50 years of age were more likely to be demotivated by perceived social risks (e.g., stigma, discrimination, HIV disclosure, and fear of transmitting HIV during a treatment interruption), compared with those >/=50 years; (2) participants >/=50 years of age were more motivated by altruistic notions compared with those <50 years; and (3) we noted greater desirability of longer long-acting ART and new HIV cure-related strategies among participants <50 years versus those >/=50 years. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of differences in perceptions among various age groups regarding desirable future ART characteristics, and motivations and barriers to participating in HIV cure-related strategies.

The Deki Reader (Fio Corporation(R), Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a portable device designed specifically for analysing RDTs and was selected for evaluation in South Africa in the context of HIV RDT analysis. METHODS: This study consisted of a laboratory evaluation and two-part field evaluation of the Deki Reader v100, covering two RDT testing algorithms, and an evaluation of the continuous quality monitoring through the Fionet web portal. Based on user feedback from the field evaluation, the device underwent hardware and software redesign, and the Deki Reader v200 was evaluated in the laboratory. Ethics approval for this evaluation was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee: M150160. RESULTS: The intra- and inter-device laboratory precision of the Deki Reader v100 were 98.3 and 99.2% respectively, and 99.3 and 100% for the Deki Reader v200. The laboratory concordances compared to standard-of-care reporting were 99.5 and 98.0% for the two respective models, while sensitivity and specificity were 99.5 and 99.4% for the Deki Reader V100 and 100 and 93.1% for the Deki Reader V200 respectively. Screening and confirmatory concordances in the field were 99.3 and 96.5% under algorithm 1 and 99.7 and 100% under algorithm 2. Sensitivity and specificity for the field evaluation were 99.8 and 97.7%. Overall robustness of the device was acceptable and continuous quality monitoring through Fionet was feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The Deki Reader provides an option for improved and reliable quality assessment for rapid diagnosis of HIV using RDTs to enhance the quality of healthcare at the point-of-care. However, the introduction of new RDTs and modification of current algorithms necessitates ongoing and agile RDT reader adjustments, which will require cost modelling to ensure sustainability of devices implemented into national HIV programs.'),\n",

       "  'People\\'s perceptions about health risks, including their risk of acquiring HIV, are impacted in part by who they see portrayed as at risk in the media. Viewers in these cases are asking themselves \"do those portrayed as at risk look like me?\" An accurate perception of risk is critical for high-risk populations, who already suffer from a range of health disparities. Yet, to date no study has evaluated the demographic representation of health-related content from social media. The objective of this case study was to apply automated image recognition software to examine the demographic profile of faces in Instagram posts containing the hashtag #HIV (obtained from January 2017 through July 2018) and compare this to the demographic breakdown of those most at risk of a new HIV diagnosis (estimates of incidence of new HIV diagnoses from the 2017 US Centers for Disease Control HIV Surveillance Report). We discovered 26,766 Instagram posts containing #HIV authored in American English with 10,036 (37.5%) containing a detectable human face with a total of 18,227 faces (mean = 1.8, standard deviation [SD] = 1.7). Faces skewed older (47% vs. 11% were 35-39 years old), more female (41% vs. 19%), more white (43% vs. 26%), less black (31% vs 44%), and less Hispanic (13% vs 25%) on Instagram than for new HIV diagnoses. The results were similarly skewed among the subset of #HIV posts mentioning pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This disparity might lead Instagram users to potentially misjudge their own HIV risk and delay prophylactic behaviors. Social media managers and organic advocates should be encouraged to share images that better reflect at-risk populations so as not to further marginalize these populations and to reduce disparity in risk perception. Replication of our methods for additional diseases, such as cancer, is warranted to discover and address other misrepresentations.'),\n",

Here we focus on step iii of the reaction of a DNA polymerase, HIV RT, with a nucleotide. We determine the rate and the free energy profile for the addition of a nucleotide to a DNA strand using a combination of a QM/MM model, the string method, and exact Milestoning. The barrier height and the time scale of the reaction are consistent with experiment. We show that the observables (free energies and mean first passage time) converge rapidly, as a function of the Milestoning iteration number. We also consider the substitution of an oxygen of the incoming nucleotide by a nonbridging sulfur atom and its impact on the enzymatic reaction. This substitution has been suggested in the past as a tool to examine the influence of the chemical step on the overall rate. Our joint computational and experimental study suggests that the impact of the substitution is small. Computationally, the differences between the two are within the estimated error bars. Experiments suggest a small difference. Finally, we examine step i, the weak binding of the nucleotide to the protein surface. We suggest that this step has only a small contribution to the selectivity of the enzyme. Comments are made on the impact of these steps on the overall mechanism.'),\n",

In Mozambique, reference values are known for young adults (18-24yo) but not yet established for a wider age range. Our study aimed to establish hematological, biochemical and immunological reference values for vaccine trials in Mozambican healthy adults with high-risk for HIV acquisition. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort and site development study in Mozambique between November 2013 and 2014 enrolled 505 participants between 18 to 35 years old. Samples from these healthy participants, were analyzed to determine reference values. All volunteers included in the analysis were clinically healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C virus, and syphilis negative. Median and reference ranges were calculated for the hematological, biochemical and immunological parameters. Ranges were compared with other African countries, the USA and the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity tables. RESULTS: A total of 505 participant samples were analyzed. Of these, 419 participants were HIV, hepatitis B and C virus and syphilis negative including 203 (48.5%) females and 216 (51.5%) males, with a mean age of 21 years. In the hematological parameters, we found significant differences between sex for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH and MCHC as well as white blood cells, neutrophils and platelets: males had higher values than females. There were also significant differences in CD4+T cell values, 803 cells/muL in men versus 926 cells/muL in women. In biochemical parameters, men presented higher values than women for the metabolic, enzymatic and renal parameters: total and direct bilirubin, ALT and creatinine. CONCLUSION: This study has established reference values for healthy adults with high-risk for HIV acquisition in Mozambique. These data are helpful in the context of future clinical research and patient care and treatment for the general adult population in the Mozambique and underline the importance of region-specific clinical reference ranges.'),\n",

The impact of steatosis on SVR in patients with HIV-HCV coinfection is unknown. (2) Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients treated with direct-acting antivirals was performed. Demographic, laboratory and direct-acting antiviral regimen data were prospectively collected. Metabolic syndrome and its components-diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity-were assessed. Hepatic steatosis (>/=5%) was defined by liver biopsy or controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement during vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). (3) Results: A total of 151 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy and direct-acting antiviral therapy were included in this analysis. Prevalence of steatosis by liver biopsy (n = 34) or CAP (>/=263 db/m) during VCTE (n = 92) was 27% and was independently associated with obesity (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.43-6.82; p = 0.004) and the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-0.15; p = 0.01).

Maturation inhibitors such as bevirimat (BVM) bind within six-helix bundles, formed by a segment that spans the junction between the CA and spacer peptide 1 (SP1) subunits of Gag, and interfere with cleavage between CA and SP1 catalyzed by the HIV-1 protease (PR). We report solid-state NMR (ssNMR) measurements on spherical virus-like particles (VLPs), facilitated by segmental isotopic labeling, that provide information about effects of BVM on the structure and dynamics of CA-SP1 junction helices in the immature lattice. Although BVM strongly blocks PR-catalyzed CA-SP1 cleavage in VLPs and blocks conversion of VLPs to tubular CA assemblies, (15)N and (13)C ssNMR chemical shifts of segmentally labeled VLPs with and without BVM are very similar, indicating that interaction with BVM does not alter the six-helix bundle structure appreciably. Only the (15)N chemical shift of A280 (the first residue of SP1) changes significantly, consistent with BVM binding to an internal ring of hydrophobic side chains of L279 residues. Measurements of transverse (15)N spin relaxation rates reveal a reduction in the amplitudes and/or timescales of backbone N-H bond motions, corresponding to a rigidification of the six-helix bundles. Overall, our data show that inhibition of HIV-1 maturation by BVM involves changes in structure and dynamics that are surprisingly subtle, but still sufficient to produce a large effect on CA-SP1 cleavage.'),\n",

Yet a commensurate response to systematically tackle stigma within country responses has not yet occurred, which may be due to the lack of sufficient evidence documenting evaluated stigma-reduction interventions. With stigma present in all life spheres, health facilities offer a logical starting point for developing and expanding stigma reduction interventions. This study evaluates the impact of a \"total facility\" stigma-reduction intervention on the drivers and manifestations of stigma and discrimination among health facility staff in Ghana. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of a total facility stigma-reduction intervention by comparing five intervention to five comparable non-intervention health facilities in Ghana. Interventions began in September 2017. Data collection was in June 2017 and April 2018. The primary outcomes were composite indicators for three stigma drivers, self-reported stigmatizing avoidance behaviour, and observed discrimination. The principal intervention variable was whether the respondent worked at an intervention or comparison facility. We estimated intervention effects as differences-in-differences in each outcome, further adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: We observed favourable intervention effects for all outcome domains except for stigmatizing attitudes. Preferring not to provide services to people living with HIV (PLHIV) or a key population member improved 11.1% more in intervention than comparison facility respondents (95% CI 3.2 to 19.0). Other significant improvements included knowledge of policies to protect against discrimination (difference-in-differences = 20.4%; 95% CI 12.7 to 28.0); belief that discrimination would be punished (11.2%; 95% CI 0.2 to 22.3); and knowledge of and belief in the adequacy of infection control policies (17.6%; 95% CI 8.3 to 26.9). Reported observation of stigma and discrimination incidents fell by 7.4 percentage points more among intervention than comparison facility respondents, though only marginally significant in the IPTW-adjusted model (p = 0.06). Respondents at intervention facilities were 19.0% (95% CI 12.2 to 25.8) more likely to report that staff behaviour towards PLHIV had improved over the last year than those at comparison facilities. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a foundation for scaling up health facility stigma-reduction within national HIV responses, though they should be accompanied by rigorous implementation science to ensure ongoing learning and adaptation for maximum effectiveness and long-term impact.'),\n",

In people living with HIV (PLWH), several lines of evidence suggest that a depletion of gut CD4 T-cells is associated with gut dysbiosis, microbial translocation and systemic inflammation. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly controls viral replication, which leads to CD4 T-cell recovery and control of the disease. However, gut dysbiosis, epithelial damage and microbial translocation persist despite ART, increasing risk of developing inflammatory non-AIDS comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, liver steatosis and cancer. In addition to ART, an emerging research priority is to discover strategies to improve the gut microbial composition and intestinal barrier function. Probiotic interventions have been extensively used with controversial benefits in humans. Encouragingly, within the last decade, the intestinal symbiotic bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila has emerged as the \"sentinel of the gut.\" A lower abundance of A. muciniphila has been shown in diabetic and obese people as well as in PLWH. Interventions with high levels of polyphenols such as tea or diets rich in fruit, the antibiotic vancomycin and the antidiabetic drug metformin have been shown to increase A. muciniphila abundance, contributing to improved metabolic function in diabetic and obese individuals. We hypothesize that gut microbiota rich in A. muciniphila can reduce microbial translocation and inflammation, preventing occurrences of non-AIDS comorbidities in PLWH. To this aim, we will discuss the protective effect of A. muciniphila and its potential applications, paving the way toward novel therapeutic strategies to improve gut health in PLWH.'),\n",

We further applied the birth-death skyline model to the sequences from Odessa (n = 275) and Kyiv (n = 92) in order to estimate changes in the epidemic's effective reproductive number (Re) and rate of becoming uninfectious (delta). We identified 12 transmission clusters in Odessa; phylogenetic clustering was correlated with younger age and higher average viral load at the time of sampling. Estimated Re were similar in Odessa and Kyiv before the initiation of TRIP; Re started to decline in 2013 and is now below Re = 1 in Odessa (Re = 0.4, 95%HPD 0.06-0.75), but not in Kyiv (Re = 2.3, 95%HPD 0.2-5.4). Similarly, estimates of delta increased in Odessa after the initiation of TRIP. Given that both cities shared the same HIV prevention programs in 2013-2019, apart from TRIP, the observed changes in transmission parameters are likely attributable to the TRIP intervention.

METHODS: A prospective study on PLWH enrolled in the UCD-ID Cohort study who switched to TAF-containing ART. Routine laboratory data [including lipids (total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides], ART history and use of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were analysed preswitch and postswitch to TAF.

This study sought to assess factors that influence the delivery of integrated FP services and the impact of facility-level integration of FP on contraceptive uptake among women living with HIV (WLWH). STUDY DESIGN: A national cross-sectional study was conducted among WLWH at HIV Care and Treatment centers with >1000 antiretroviral treatment (ART) clients per year. A mobile team visited 108 HIV Care and Treatment centers and administered surveys to key informants regarding facility attributes and WLWH regarding FP at these centers between June and September 2016. We classified facilities offering FP services within the same facility as 'integrated' facilities. RESULTS: 4805 WLWH were enrolled at 108 facilities throughout Kenya. The majority (73%) of facilities offered integrated FP services. They were more likely to be offered in public than private facilities (Prevalence Ratio [PR]: 1.86, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-3.11; p=0.02] and were more common in the Nyanza region than the Nairobi region (77% vs 35% respectively, p=0.06). Any contraceptive use (89% vs 80%), use of modern contraception (88% vs 80%), dual method use (40% vs 30%), long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) (28% vs 20%), and non-barrier short-term methods (34% vs 27%) were all significantly higher in facilities with integrated FP services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of high volume facilities integrated FP services into HIV care. Integrating FP services may increase modern contraceptive use among WLWH. IMPLICATIONS: Integration of FP services was associated with higher modern contraceptive use, lower unmet need for modern methods and higher use of long-acting, reversible contraception (LARC), and non-barrier short-term methods among women living with HIV.

To fill the gap, and as the CDC recommends, this study aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing HIV screening in dental setting, identify patient characteristics associated with acceptance of HIV rapid testing, and discuss best practices of HIV screening in dental setting. New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) collaborated with the Northeast/Caribbean AIDS Education and Training Center (NECA AETC) and three dental schools in New York State to offer free HIV screening tests as a component of routine dental care between February 2016 and March 2018. Ten clinics in upstate New York and Long Island participated in the study. HIV screening was performed using the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test. 14,887 dental patients were offered HIV screening tests; 9,057 (60.8%) were screened; and one patient (0.011%) was confirmed HIV positive and linked to medical care. Of all dental patients, 33% had never been screened for HIV; and 56% had not had a primary care visit or had not been offered an HIV screening test by primary care providers in the previous 12 months. Multi-level generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that test acceptance was significantly associated with patient's age, race/ethnicity, gender, country of origin, primary payer (or insurance), past primary care visits, past HIV testing experiences, and the poverty level of patient's community. HIV screening is well accepted by dental patients and can be effectively integrated into routine dental care. HIV screening in the dental setting can be a good option for first-time testers, those who have not seen a primary care provider in the last 12 months, and those who have not been offered HIV screening at their last primary care visit.\"),\n",

       "  'HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimers, stabilized in a prefusion-closed conformation, can elicit humoral responses capable of neutralizing HIV-1 strains closely matched in sequence to the immunizing strain. One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.'),\n",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study in PLWH enrolled into the Mater Immunology study.

RESULTS: 190 ambulatory PLWH recruited to the main study, 143 were included in the analysis (38 had no stored DNA and 9 no T-lymphocyte subpopulation). Of 143 included, the median age (IQR) was 45(39-48) years, 64% were male and 66% were of Caucasian ethnicity. Heterosexual-contact (36%), injecting drug-use (33%) and men who have sex with men (24%) were the most presented HIV-transmission risk groups. The majority of subjects (90.2%) were on ART with 79% of the cohort having an undetectable HIV-RNA (< 40 copies/ml) and the time since ART initiation was 7.5 (3.7-10.4) year. rs368234815 and rs12979860 displayed similar allelic frequencies, with minor alleles DeltaG and T representing 39% and 42%, respectively, of circulating alleles. rs368234815 DeltaG/DeltaG minor homozygotes were significantly associated with increased odds for attaining a normalised CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio compared to rs368234815 T/T major homozygotes in PLWH virologically suppressed on effective ART (OR = 3.11; 95% CI [1.01:9.56]). rs368234815 DeltaG/DeltaG homozygosity was also significantly associated with lower levels of CD4(+) effector memory T-cells (regression coefficient: - 7.1%, p = 0.04) and CD8(+) naive T-cell subsets were significantly higher in HIV-1 mono-infected PLWH with rs368234815 DeltaG/DeltaG (regression coefficient: + 7.2%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In virally-suppressed, long-term ART-treated PLWH, rs368234815 DeltaG/DeltaG homozygotes were more likely to have attained normalisation of their CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio, displayed lower CD4(+) effector memory and higher naive CD8(+) T-cells.

We assessed relationships between ART drug class and weight change among treatment-naive PWH initiating ART in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). METHODS: Adult, treatment-naive PWH in NA-ACCORD initiating integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART on/after 1 January 2007 were followed through 31 December 2016. Multivariate linear mixed effects models estimated weight up to five years after ART initiation, adjusting for age, sex, race, cohort site, HIV acquisition mode, treatment year, and baseline weight, plasma HIV-1 RNA level and CD4(+) cell count. Due to shorter follow-up for PWH receiving newer INSTI drugs, weights for specific INSTIs were estimated at two years. Secondary analyses using logistic regression and all covariates from primary analyses assessed factors associated with >10% weight gain at two and five years. RESULTS: Among 22,972 participants, 87% were male, and 41% were white. 49% started NNRTI-, 31% started PI- and 20% started INSTI-based regimens (1624 raltegravir (RAL), 2085 elvitegravir (EVG) and 929 dolutegravir (DTG)). PWH starting INSTI-based regimens had mean estimated five-year weight change of +5.9kg, compared to +3.7kg for NNRTI and +5.5kg for PI. Among PWH starting INSTI drugs, mean estimated two-year weight change was +7.2kg for DTG, +5.8kg for RAL and +4.1kg for EVG. Women, persons with lower baseline CD4(+) cell counts, and those initiating INSTI-based regimens had higher odds of >10% body weight increase at two years (adjusted odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.20 to 1.56 vs. NNRTI). CONCLUSIONS: PWH initiating INSTI-based regimens gained, on average, more weight compared to NNRTI-based regimens. This phenomenon may reflect heterogeneous effects of ART agents on body weight regulation that require further exploration.'),\n",

The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of 142 patients enrolled 68% (n=96/142, 95% confidence interval (CI) [60-75%]) were HIV-positive, 41% (n=39/96, 95% CI [31-50%]) of whom were ART-naive. Among HIV-positive patients, both opportunistic pathogens (TB LAM-positivity, 36%, 95% CI [24-48%]; CrAg-positivity, 15%, 95% CI [7-23%]) and severe non-AIDS infections (S. pneumoniae urine antigen-positivity 12%, 95% CI [4-20%]; bacteraemia 17% (n=16/96, 95% CI [9-24%]), of which 56% (n=9/16, 95% CI [30-80%]) were gram-negative organisms) were common. Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from blood and urine was uniformly resistant to ceftriaxone, as were most Escherichia coli isolates.

DESIGN: Multilevel cross-sectional analysis using viral load data and facility surveys from HIV treatment programs throughout Kenya. METHODS: We abstracted medical records of AYA in HIV care, analyzed the subset on ART for more than 6 months between January 2016 and December 2017, and collected information on services at each clinic. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to determine correlates of viral suppression at most recent assessment. RESULTS: In 99 HIV clinics, among 10 096 AYA on ART more than 6 months, 2683 (27%) had unsuppressed viral load at last test. Among 16% of clinics, more than 80% of AYA were virally suppressed. Clinic-level correlates of individual viral suppression included designated adolescent spaces [aOR: 1.32, 95% CI (1.07-1.63)] and faster viral load turnaround time [aOR: 1.06 (95% CI 1.03-1.09)]. Adjusting for clinic-level factors, AYA aged 10-14 and 15-19 years had lower odds of viral suppression compared with AYA aged 20-24 years [aOR: 0.61 (0.54-0.69) and 0.59 (0.52-0.67], respectively. Compared with female patients, male patients had lower odds of viral suppression [aOR: 0.69 (0.62-0.77)]. Compared with ART duration of 6-12 months, ART for 2-5, above 5-10 or more than 10 years was associated with poor viral suppression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dedicated adolescent space, rapid viral load turnaround time, and tailored approaches for male individuals and perinatally infected AYA may improve viral suppression.

The Index of Engagement in HIV care (the Index) measures the degree to which a patient feels engaged/disengaged from HIV care. However, its measurement invariance, or the degree to which observed scores can be meaningfully compared across racial/ethnic groups, has not been established. Methods: The 10-item Index is a self-report measure initially validated in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems cohort study. Using Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems survey data, Index scores were linked to patients' electronic medical records, which included viral load (VL) and appointment attendance data. We conducted measurement invariance analyses to test the Index's performance in the 3 racial/ethnic groups and its cross-sectional association with VL and retention in HIV care (2 primary outcomes). Results: A total of 3,127 patients completed the Index, which showed good reliability across the 3 groups (alphas >.84). Confirmatory factor analysis model fit statistics showed that the Index demonstrated configural, metric, and scalar invariance, supporting the conclusion that the Index is a single factor construct. Lastly, lower Index scores associated with a concurrent detectable VL and poor retention in HIV care for all 3 groups. Conclusion: Having demonstrated invariance, the Index scores can be used to compare engagement levels across non-Latino Whites, Latinos, and African Americans in HIV care settings. Improving HIV care retention requires tools that can accurately identify people struggling to stay engaged in HIV care, especially racial/ethnic minorities.

Past studies suggest that this association may be due to the tendency for intoxication to interfere with condom use. However, research on potential causal mechanisms explaining this relationship has been limited primarily to laboratory studies. In this study, we tested several potential mediators of the relationship between alcohol use level and HIV risk behavior. DESIGN: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods conducted over a 30-day period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS/CASES: MSM (n = 100) in the northeastern United States. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed daily diary surveys and up to six experience sampling surveys randomly prompted throughout the day. FINDINGS: Very heavy levels of drinking (12+ drinks) increased the odds of engaging in any sex [odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, P < 0.001]. Coefficient products and 95% confidence intervals indicated that both subjective sexual arousal (OR = 1.52, P < 0.001) and sex intentions (OR = 1.74, P < 0.001) significantly mediated the association between very heavy drinking and the odds of sex. When participants reported sex, the odds of engaging in high-risk condomless anal sex (CAS) increased incrementally after drinking heavily (five to 11 drinks; OR = 3.27, P = 0.006) and very heavily (12+ drinks; OR = 4.42, P < 0.001). Only subjective sexual arousal significantly mediated the association between alcohol use level and high-risk CAS (OR = 1.16, P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in subjective sexual arousal after drinking heavily appear to partly account for alcohol-related HIV risk behaviors in the daily lives of men who have sex with men. Alcohol's role in strengthening motivationally consistent emotional states may therefore play a more important role in facilitating alcohol-involved HIV risk than explicit sexual motivation.\"),\n",

However, life-threatening immune-related adverse events can result from these immunotherapy treatments. Case presentation. A 62-year-old man with HIV, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, and no previous history of diabetes presented to the emergency department with new-onset nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness. Glucose was 1191 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c 11%, and potassium 6.9 mEq/L. He had metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 6.6 mmol/L and anion gap of 38 mEq/L, and ketones were detected on the urinalysis. Severe diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additional investigations showed low C-peptide and negative anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, anti-insulin antibody, and anti-islet-antigen 2Ab antibody. After ruling out other possible etiologies, pembrolizumab was considered to be the cause of the diabetes and ketoacidosis. Conclusions: Life-threatening adverse drug events associated with checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab are on the rise. We recommend to closely follow and monitor patients receiving these immunotherapies. This strategy could lead to early detection and prevention, as well as reduction of more serious life-threatening complications requiring intensive care.'),\n",

Structurally defined mimics of native trimeric Env glycoproteins (e.g., SOSIP trimers) present multiple epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and their germline precursors, but elicitation of bNAbs remains elusive. Here, we argue that the interactions between Env and the immune system render it exceptional among viral vaccine antigens and hinder its immunogenicity in absolute and comparative terms. In other words, Env binds to CD4 on key immune cells and transduces signals that can compromise their function. Moreover, the extensive array of oligomannose glycans on Env shields peptidic B cell epitopes, impedes the presentation of T helper cell epitopes, and attracts mannose binding proteins, which could affect the antibody response. We suggest lines of research for assessing how to overcome obstacles that the exceptional features of Env impose on the creation of a successful HIV-1 vaccine.'),\n",

We set out to determine PrEP eligibility, uptake and predictors of PrEP uptake among MSM enrolled in an HIV-1 vaccine feasibility cohort in coastal Kenya. Methods: We compared the number of MSM identified as eligible for PrEP from June-December 2017 by Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) criteria, which do not include reported anal intercourse, to those identified as eligible by a published MSM cohort-derived HIV-1 risk score (CDHRS). We determined PrEP uptake and assessed factors associated with uptake at first offer among eligible MSM followed up monthly. Results: Out of 167 MSM assessed for PrEP eligibility, 118 (70.7%) were identified by both MoH and CDHRS eligibility criteria; 33 (19.8%) by CDHRS alone, 11 (6.6%) by MoH criteria alone, and 5 (3.0%) by neither criterion. Of the men identified by CDHRS alone, the majority (24 or 72.7%) reported receptive anal intercourse (RAI). Of the 162 MSM eligible for PrEP, 113 (69.7%) accepted PrEP at first offer. Acceptance of PrEP was higher for men reporting RAI (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.9), having paid for sex (aPR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6) and group sex (aPR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8), after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Conclusions: Assessing PrEP eligibility using the CDHRS identified 20% more at-risk MSM for PrEP initiation than when Kenyan MoH criteria were used. Approximately 70% of eligible men accepted PrEP at first offer, suggesting that PrEP is acceptable among at-risk MSM. MSM reporting RAI, group sex, or paying for sex were more likely to accept PrEP. Incorporating RAI into MoH PrEP eligibility criteria would enhance the impact of PrEP programming in Kenya.'),\n",

We assessed the prevalence of diabetes and the roles of HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and traditional risk factors among adults in Tanzania. METHODS: We analysed diabetes-relevant baseline data from 1,947 adult participants in the CICADA study in Mwanza, Tanzania: 655 HIV-uninfected, 956 HIV-infected ART-naive, and 336 HIV-infected persons on ART. WHO guidelines for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were used to define diabetes and prediabetes. Risk factors were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Relative risk ratios (RRR) were generated comparing participants with diabetes and prediabetes against the reference of those with no diabetes. RESULTS: Mean age was 41 (SD 12) years; 59% were women. The prevalence of diabetes was 13% by HbA1c and 6% by OGTT, with partial overlap among participants identified by the two tests. Relative to HIV-uninfected, HIV-infected ART-naive persons had increased relative risks of diabetes (HbA1c: RRR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.25-3.03; OGTT: RRR = 1.90, 95% CI 0.96-3.73) and prediabetes (HbA1c: RRR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.93-4.34; OGTT: RRR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.13). HIV-infected participants on ART showed increased risk of prediabetes (RRR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09, 2.94) by HbA1c, but not diabetes. CD4 count < 200 cell/muL at recruitment increased risk and physical activity decreased risk of diabetes by both HbA1c and OGTT. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetes was high, especially among HIV-infected ART-naive adults. Being more physically active was associated with lower risk of diabetes. HbA1c and OGTT identified different participants as having diabetes or prediabetes. Overall, the finding of high burden of diabetes among HIV-infected persons suggests that health systems should consider integrating diabetes screening and treatment in HIV clinics to optimize the care of HIV patients and improve their health outcomes.'),\n",

Non-SCD congenital anemia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition compared to SCD (OR 13.1 95%CI 1.6-108.9). In addition, we prospectively enrolled 30 SCD cases and 30 non-SCD controls to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance to HIV in SCD. CCR5 and CCR7 expression was lower and CD4 expression was higher on CD4+ T cells from SCD cases compared to controls. Surface expression of CD4+ T cell CXCR4, CD38 and HLA-DR did not differ between the groups. SCD CD4+ T cells were not less susceptible to HIV infection than controls. Levels of multiple cytokines were elevated in the SCD plasma, but SCD plasma compared to control plasma did not inhibit HIV infection of target cells. In conclusion, our epidemiological data support people with SCD being resistant to HIV infection. Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection. Further study is needed to define the risk and pathophysiology of HIV in persons with SCD.'),\n",

However, context-specific strategies are necessary to find the hidden children to meet the full 90% target. This study assesses whether sex of the caregiver is associated with HIV status of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as a valuable strategy for enhanced pediatric case findings. METHODS: Data originate from the community-based, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kizazi Kipya Project, which works towards increasing OVC's and their caregivers' uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services in Tanzania. Included in this study are 39,578 OVC ages 0-19 years who the project enrolled during January through March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania and who voluntarily reported their HIV status. Data analysis involved multi-level logistic regression, with OVC HIV status as the outcome of interest and caregiver's sex as the main independent variable. RESULTS: Three-quarters (74.3%) of the OVC included in the study had female caregivers, and their overall HIV prevalence was 7.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among OVC with male caregivers (7.8%) than among OVC with female caregivers (6.8%), and indeed, multivariate analysis showed that OVC with male caregivers were significantly 40% more likely to be HIV-positive than those with female caregivers (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.83). This effect was the strongest among 0-4 year-olds (OR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.61-10.03), declined to 1.72 among 5-9 year-olds (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.93), and lost significance for children over age 9 years. Other significant factors included OVC age and nutritional status; caregiver HIV status and marital status; household health insurance status, and family size; and rural versus urban residence. CONCLUSIONS: OVC in Tanzania with male caregivers have a 40% higher likelihood of being HIV-positive than those with female caregivers. HIV risk assessment activities should target OVC with male caregivers, as well as OVC who have malnutrition, HIV-positive caregivers, or caregivers who do not disclose their HIV status to community volunteers. Further, younger HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in rural areas, while older HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in urban areas.

The Visitect CD4 Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) is a disposable POC test, providing a visually interpreted result of above or below 200 CD4cells/mm3. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of this index test. METHODS: Consenting patients above 18years of age and eligible for CD4 testing were enrolled in Nsanje district hospital (Malawi), Gutu mission hospital (Zimbabwe) and Centre hopitalier de Kabinda (DRC). A total of 708 venous blood samples were tested in the index test and in the BD FACSCount assay (reference test method) in the laboratories (Phase 1) to determine diagnostic accuracy. A total of 433 finger-prick (FP) samples were tested on the index test at POC by clinicians (Phase 2) and a self-completed questionnaire was administered to all testers to explore usability of the index test. RESULTS: Among 708 patients, 67.2% were female and median CD4 was 297cells/mm3. The sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA using venous blood in the laboratory was 95.0% [95% CI: 91.3-97.5] and specificity was 81.9% [95% CI: 78.2-85.2%]. Using FP samples, the sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA was 98.3% [95% CI: 95.0-99.6] and specificity was 77.2% [95% CI: 71.6-82.2%]. Usability of the Visitect CD4 LFA was high across the study sites with 97% successfully completed tests. Due to the required specific multiple incubation and procedural steps during the Visitect CD4 LFA testing, few health workers (7/26) were not confident to manage testing whilst multi-tasking in their clinical work. CONCLUSIONS: Visitect CD4 LFA is a promising test for decentralized CD4 screening in resource-limited settings, without access to CD4 testing and and it can trigger prompt management of patients with AHD.

METHODS: We used the IBMMarketScan databases for U.S. commercially insured and Medicaid covered adults to identify PLWH newly initiated on ART between January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2015. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE), a composite of acute MI, ischemic stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary intervention was the primary outcome. We used calendar time-specific probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between INSTI use and MACE. We used propensity score weighting methods to account for potential confounding. RESULTS: Twenty thousand two hundred forty-two new ART initiators were identified. 5069 (25%) PLWH initiated INSTI-based regimens. 203 MACE events occurred; acute MI 16 (0.32%) vs 66 (0.43%), stroke 24 (0.47%) vs 54 (0.36), coronary artery bypass grafting 2 (0.04%) vs 9 (0.06%), percutaneous coronary intervention 7 (0.14%) vs 25 (0.16%) of INSTI users vs non-users.

There will be three waves of data collection separated by 6 months. At each wave, participants will provide information on their relationships, social and sexual networks, and neighbourhoods. Global position system technology will be used to generate individual daily path areas in order to estimate neighbourhood-level exposures. Multivariate analyses will be conducted to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal, independent and synergistic associations of personal relationships (notably individual social capital), social and sexual networks, and neighbourhood factors (notably neighbourhood-level social cohesion) with PrEP uptake and discontinuation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The TURNNT protocol was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board (reference no. AAAS8164). This study will provide novel insights into the relationship, network and neighbourhood factors that influence HIV prevention behaviours among transgender women of colour and facilitate exploration of this population's health and well-being more broadly. Through community-based dissemination events and consultation with policy makers, this foundational work will be used to guide the development and implementation of future interventions with and for transgender women of colour.\"),\n",

A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and identify factors associated with its infection among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive individuals in contact with livestock in Namwala district of Zambia. Three hundred and twenty six stool samples were collected from HIV infected individuals presenting at local health centers in Namwala district of Zambia between August 2015 and June 2016. The Meriflour Cryptosporidium/Giardia test kit was used to test for presence of oocysts. Demographic information such as age and sex and information on hypothesized risk factors was collected using a structured questionnaire. Overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was 9.5% (95% CI = 6.7-13.2%); 13.3% and 7.1% among male and female participants, respectively. Males were 2.5 times more likely to be infected than females whereas the divorced had higher odds of being infected (OR = 14.8). Participants who kept animals had a higher prevalence (11.4%) than those that did not (7.0%). Those that shared water with neighbors were 5.7 times more likely to be infected than those who did not. We conclude that Cryptosporidium infection is prevalent among HIV positive adults in Namwala district and infection is associated with sex, marital status and sharing water sources among neighbors. Community sensitization is required to create awareness and reduce human exposure to Cryptosporidium infection.'),\n",

       "  \"BACKGROUND: Despite the high burden of new HIV infections in minor adolescents, they are often excluded from biomedical HIV prevention trials, largely owing to the ethical complexities of obtaining consent for enrollment. Researchers and ethics regulators have a duty to protect adolescents-as a special category of human subjects, they must have protection that extends beyond those afforded to all human subjects. Typically, additional protection includes parental consent for enrollment. However, parental consent can present a risk of harm for minor adolescents. Research involving minor adolescents indicate that they are unwilling to join biomedical trials for stigmatized health problems, such as HIV, when parental consent is required. This presents a significant barrier to progress in adolescent HIV prevention by creating delays in research and the translation of new scientific evidence generated in biomedical trials in adult populations. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to examine how parental involvement in the consent process affects the acceptability of hypothetical participation in biomedical HIV prevention trials from the perspectives of minor adolescents and parents of minor adolescents. METHODS: In this protocol, we use a quasi-experimental design that involves a simulated consent process for 2 different HIV prevention trials. The first trial is modeled after an open-label study of the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine as preexposure prophylaxis for HIV. The second trial is modeled after a phase IIa trial of an injectable HIV integrase inhibitor. There are 2 groups in the study-minor adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, inclusive, and parents of minor adolescents in the same age range. The adolescent participants are randomized to 1 of 3 consent conditions with varying degrees of parental involvement. After undergoing a simulated consent process, they rate their willingness to participate (WTP) in each of the 2 trials if offered the opportunity. The primary outcome is WTP, given the consent condition. Parents undergo a similar process but are asked to rate the acceptability of each of the 3 consent conditions. The primary outcome is acceptability of the consent method for enrollment. The secondary outcomes include the following: capacity to consent among both participant groups, the prevalence of medical mistrust, and the effects of the study phase (eg, phase IIa vs the open-label study) and drug administration route (eg, oral vs injection) on WTP (adolescents) and acceptability (parents) of the consent method. RESULTS: Enrollment began in April 2018 and ended mid-September 2019. Data are being analyzed and dissemination is expected in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The study will provide the needed empirical data about minor adolescents' and parents' perspectives on consent methods for minors. The evidence generated can be used to guide investigators and ethics regulators in the design of consent processes for biomedical HIV prevention trials.

       "  'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic inflammation is a major component of HIV infection, the effects of which can be devastating in the central nervous system (CNS). Protecting the brain is, therefore, critical as efforts proceed to cure HIV infection by reactivating latent viral reservoirs and driving immune responses. We review the clinical presentation and pathology findings of inflammatory processes in the CNS in patients managed with ART and the drivers of these processes. RECENT FINDINGS: Chronic inflammation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and HIV infection increases the risk for chronic diseases, especially cognitive impairment. Latent viral reservoirs, including microglia and tissue macrophages, contribute to inflammation in the CNS. Inflammation is generated and maintained through residual viral replication, dysregulation of infected cells, continuously produced viral proteins and positive feedback loops of chronic inflammation. Novel therapeutics and lifestyle changes may help to protect the CNS from immune-mediated damage. SUMMARY: As therapies are developed to cure HIV, it is important to protect the CNS from additional immune-mediated damage. Adjunctive therapies to restore glial function, reduce neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation, and inhibit expression of viral proteins are needed.'),\n",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the use of SMS to capture clinical outcomes that occur at home and identify potential biases in reporting compared to in-person ascertainment. METHODS: In the PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents program, which integrated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) into antenatal care, postnatal care, and family planning facilities in Kisumu County, Kenya, HIV-negative women 14 years of age or older were offered oral HIV self-tests (HIVSTs) to take home to male partners. Women that brought a phone with a Safaricom SIM to the clinic were offered registration in an automated SMS system (mSurvey) to collect information on HIVST outcomes. Women were asked if they offered the test to their male partners, and asked about the test process and results. HIVST outcomes were collected via SMS (sent 2.5 weeks later), in-person (if women returned for a follow-up scheduled 1 month later), or using both methods (if women initiated PrEP, they also had scheduled follow-up visits). The SMS prompted women to reply at no charge. HIVST outcomes were compared between women with scheduled follow-up visits and those without (follow-up visits were only scheduled for women who initiated PrEP). HIVST outcomes were also compared between women reporting via SMS and in-person. RESULTS: Among 2123 women offered HIVSTs and mSurvey registration, 486 (23.89%) accepted HIVSTs, of whom 359 (73.87%) were eligible for mSurvey. Additionally, 76/170 (44.7%) women with scheduled follow-up visits and 146/189 (77.3%) without scheduled follow-up visits registered in mSurvey. Among the 76 women with scheduled follow-ups, 62 (82%) had HIVST outcomes collected: 19 (31%) in-person, 20 (32%) by SMS, and 23 (37%) using both methods. Among the 146 women without scheduled visits, 87 (59.6%) had HIVST outcomes collected: 3 (3%) in-person, 82 (94%) by SMS, and 2 (2%) using both methods. SMS increased the collection of HIVST outcomes substantially for women with scheduled follow-up visits (1.48-fold), and captured 82 additional reports from women without scheduled follow-up visits. Among 222 women with reported HIVST outcomes, frequencies of offering partners the HIVST (85/95, 89% in-person vs 96/102, 94% SMS; P=.31), partners using the HIVST (83/85, 98% vs 92/96, 96%; P=.50), women using HIVST with partners (82/83, 99% vs 91/92, 99%; P=.94), and seeing partner's HIVST results (82/83, 99% vs 89/92, 97%; P=.56) were similar between women reporting in-person only versus by SMS only. However, frequency of reports of experiencing harm or negative reactions from partners was more commonly reported in the SMS group (17/102, 16.7% vs 2/85, 2%; P=.003). Barriers to the SMS system registration included not having a Safaricom SIM or a functioning phone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the use of SMS substantially improves completeness of outcome data, does not bias reporting of nonsensitive information, and may increase reporting of sensitive information. .\"),\n",

The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection and associated risk factors among PWID in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, following the introduction of a comprehensive HIV intervention package (CHIP) for PWID in the country in 2014. METHODS: We conducted an integrated bio-behavioral survey (IBBS) among PWID using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between October and December 2017. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and risky behaviors were collected through face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected and tested for HIV infection. We accounted for weighting in the analyses, and logistic regression was performed to assess risk factors for HIV infection. RESULTS: A total of 611 PWID (94.4% males and 5.6% females) with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-38) were recruited. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 8.7% (95% CI 6.5-10.9). The prevalence of HIV infections for males and females were 6.8% (95% CI 4.7-8.9%) and 41.2% (95% CI 23.7-58.6%) respectively. Adjusted weighted logistic regression analysis (WLRA) showed that being a female (aOR 19.1; 95% CI 5.9-61.8), injecting drugs for more than 10 years (aOR = 7.32; 95% CI 2.1-25.5) compared to 1 year or less and being 45 years or older (aOR = 34.22; 95% CI 2.4-489.5) compared to being 25 years or younger were associated with increased odds of HIV infection. Use of a sterile needle at last injection decreased odds of HIV infection (aOR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The present study observed a decline in prevalence of HIV infections among PWID in Dar es Salaam (8.7%) compared to a previous estimate of 15.5% from an IBBS conducted in 2013. Despite the decrease, HIV prevalence remains high among PWID compared to the general population, and women are disproportionally affected. The decline may be possibly attributed to the on-going implementation of CHIP for PWID, highlighting the need for strengthening the existing harm reduction interventions by incorporating access to sterile needle/syringe and addressing the layered risks for women.'),\n",

This systematic review assessed trends of lifetime self-reported PrEP use and disparities among key populations. METHODS: We used the CDC HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis cumulative database of electronic and manual searches in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from 2000 to 2019 to identify English-language primary studies reporting PrEP use. Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated pooled proportions and crude/adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: We identified 95 eligible studies including 95,854 US-based survey respondents. A few studies (6.3%) focused on persons who inject drugs. In 2015-2017, men who have sex with men (MSM) had highest proportion of individuals who used PrEP over their lifetime [13.9% (95% confidence interval: 8.8 to 21.1), k (number of surveys) = 49] followed by Hispanic/Latinos [11.5 (7.1 to 18.1), 12], transgender women [11.2 (5.8 to 20.6), 5], and blacks [9.9 (8.3 to 11.8), 18]. Odds of PrEP use increased by 34%/year [odds ratio = 1.34/year (95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.64)] and significantly increased over time among MSM [1.53/year (1.21-1.93)] and blacks [1.44 (1.13-1.83)]. People in the Southern United States [9.9 (4.7-19.7), 8] and youth [7.3 (4.7-11.2), 8] had lower rates and did not demonstrate growth [0.94 (0.29-3.18); 0.82 (0.43-1.55)]. Odds of reporting lifetime PrEP use was twice [2.07 (1.27-3.38)] as great among MSM than non-MSM. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of PrEP use in published surveys have been growing, but remain low for people in the Southern United States and youth, and understudied in persons who inject drugs. Limitations include few studies in certain years, whereas strengths include a large number of respondents.

STUDY DESIGN: Patients initiating PrEP were followed quarterly until they withdrew from PrEP care or the study ended. Self-reported OOP medication and clinic visit costs were assessed by semiannual questionnaires. Persistence was defined as the time from study enrollment to the last visit after which two subsequent 3-month visits were missed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the effect of demographics, insurance, and OOP costs on PrEP persistence. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 918 participants with OOP cost data, the average quarterly OOP cost was $34 (median: $5, IQR: $0-$25). Participants who were men, White, employed, completed college, and had commercial insurance had higher OOP costs. Higher OOP costs were not associated with lower PrEP persistence by Cox proportional hazards regression (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.00 per $50 increase, 95% CI = 0.97, 1.02).

Aiming to compare the phenotypic characteristics of ST5 and non-ST5 C. neoformans, we selected 30 representative Vietnamese isolates and compared their in vitro pathogenic potential and in vivo virulence. ST5 and non-ST5 organisms exhibited comparable characteristics with respect to in vitro virulence markers including melanin production, replication at 37 degrees C, and growth in cerebrospinal fluid. However, the ST5 isolates had significantly increased variability in cellular and capsular sizing compared with non-ST5 organisms (P < .001). Counterintuitively, mice infected with ST5 isolates had significantly longer survival with lower fungal burdens at day 7 than non-ST5 isolates. Notably, ST5 isolates induced significantly greater initial inflammatory responses than non-ST5 strains, measured by TNF-alpha concentrations (P < .001). Despite being generally less virulent in the mouse model, we hypothesize that the significant within strain variation seen in ST5 isolates in the tested phenotypes may represent an evolutionary advantage enabling adaptation to novel niches including apparently immunocompetent human hosts.'),\n",

Literature regarding HIV prevention strategies for this vulnerable, often-hidden population is scant. Before effective, population-based HIV prevention strategies may be adequately developed, it is necessary to first enhance the contextual understanding of transgender youth HIV risk and experiences with HIV preventive services. METHODS: Two 3-day, online, asynchronous focus groups were conducted with transgender youth from across the United States to better understand participant HIV risk and experiences with HIV preventive services. Participants were recruited by using online advertisements posted via youth organizations. Qualitative data were analyzed by using content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 transgender youth participated. The average age was 18.6 years, and youth reported a wide range of gender identities (eg, 27% were transgender male, 17% were transgender female, and 27% used >/=1 term) and sexual orientations. Four themes emerged: (1) barriers to self-efficacy in sexual decision-making; (2) safety concerns, fear, and other challenges in forming romantic and/or sexual relationships; (3) need for support and education; and (4) desire for affirmative and culturally competent experiences and interactions (eg, home, school, and health care). CONCLUSIONS: Youth discussed experiences and perspectives related to their gender identities, sexual health education, and HIV preventive services. Findings should inform intervention development to improve support and/or services, including the following: (1) increasing provider knowledge and skills to provide gender-affirming care, (2) addressing barriers to services (eg, accessibility and affordability as well as stigma and discrimination), and (3) expanding sexual health education to be inclusive of all gender identities, sexual orientations, and definitions of sex and sexual activity.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. FINDINGS: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96.2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per muL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2.48, 95% CI 2.05-3.08) but not after 30 days (1.25, 0.84-2.49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3.15, 95% CI 1.16-8.84). INTERPRETATION: In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients. FUNDING: This study was supported by Wellcome fellowships 109105Z/15/A and 105165/Z/14/A.'),\n",

Here, we present longer term data for this patient (up to 30 months after ATI), including sampling from diverse HIV-1 reservoir sites. METHODS: We used ultrasensitive viral load assays of plasma, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to detect HIV-1 RNA. In gut biopsy samples and lymph-node tissue, cell-copy number and total HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified in multiple replicates, using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. We also analysed the presence of intact proviral DNA using multiplex ddPCR targeting the packaging signal (psi) and envelope (env). We did intracellular cytokine staining to measure HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. We used low-sensitive and low-avidity antibody assays to measure the humoral response to HIV-1. We predicted the probability of rebound using a mathematical model and inference approach. FINDINGS: HIV-1 viral load in plasma remained undetectable in the London patient up to 30 months (last tested on March 4, 2020), using an assay with a detection limit of 1 copy per mL. The patient's CD4 count was 430 cells per muL (23.5% of total T cells) at 28 months. A very low-level positive signal for HIV-1 DNA was recorded in peripheral CD4 memory cells at 28 months. The viral load in semen was undetectable in both plasma (lower limit of detection [LLD] <12 copies per mL) and cells (LLD 10 copies per 10(6) cells) at 21 months. CSF was within normal parameters at 25 months, with HIV-1 RNA below the detection limit (LLD 1 copy per mL). HIV-1 DNA by ddPCR was negative in rectum, caecum, and sigmoid colon and terminal ileum tissue samples at 22 months. Lymph-node tissue from axilla was positive for the long-terminal repeat (33 copies per 10(6) cells) and env (26.1 copies per 10(6) cells), negative for psi and integrase, and negative by the intact proviral DNA assay, at 27 months. HIV-1-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses have remained absent at 27 months. Low-avidity Env antibodies have continued to decline. Mathematical modelling suggests that the probability of remission for life (cure) is 98% in the context of 80% donor chimerism in total HIV target cells and greater than 99% probability of remission for life with 90% donor chimerism. INTERPRETATION: The London patient has been in HIV-1 remission for 30 months with no detectable replication-competent virus in blood, CSF, intestinal tissue, or lymphoid tissue. Donor chimerism has been maintained at 99% in peripheral T cells. We propose that these findings represent HIV-1 cure.

METHODS: Adult (>/=15 years) patients with baseline CD4 counts < 500 cells/mul that initiated treatment at one of two HIV treatment centers in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire between 1998 and 2004 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were stratified by baseline CD4 counts and survival analyses were employed to examine the relationship between HIV type and time to achieving CD4 >/= 500 cells/mul during follow up. RESULTS: Among 3487 patients, median follow-up time was 4 years and 57% had documented ART regimens for > 75% of their recorded visits. Kaplan-Meier estimates for achievement of CD4 >/= 500 cells/mul after 6 years of follow-up for patients in the lower CD4 strata (< 200 cells/mul) were 40% (HIV-1), 31% (HIV-dual), and 17% (HIV-2) (log-rank p < 0.001). Cox Regression indicated that HIV-1 was significantly associated with achievement of CD4 >/= 500 cells/mul during follow-up, compared to HIV-2.

Despite the unavailability of clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for antifungal agents, epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) were recently proposed, and non-wild-type isolates for polyenes and azoles are being increasingly reported. However, the distributions of the susceptibility patterns for pre-HIV-era isolates have not been studied. Methods: We determined the in vitro antifungal susceptibility patterns of 233 Cryptococcus isolates, collected at the National Institutes of Health, USA, in pre-HIV pandemic era, to study minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to the important drugs for cryptococcosis and to compare the results with strain genotypes. Amphotericin B susceptibility was compared to published ECV of C. neoformans. Results: The 233 Cryptococcus strains consisted of 89.7% C. neoformans species complex and 10.3% C. gattii species complex. Most were from clinical sources (189, 81.1%), and the major molecular type was VNI (146, 62.7%). The highest geometric mean (GM) was observed for fluconazole (GM = 0.96 microg/mL) while the lowest was for itraconazole (GM = 0.10 microg/mL). MICs to fluconazole in C. gattii species complex were significantly higher than C. neoformans species complex (p < 0.001). Moreover, C. neoformans/VNI strains showed significantly higher MICs than others such as C. neoformans/VNII to fluconazole (p < 0.0001) and C. deneoformans/VNIV to amphotericin B (p = 0.022) and fluconazole (p = 0.008). In our collection of 167 clinical C. neoformans species complex strains, 85 (50.9%), 24 (14.4%), and 3 (1.8%) strains had an amphotericin B (AMB)-MIC of 1, 2, and 4 microg/mL, respectively. The high percentage (66.9%, 79/118 strains) of non-wild-type clinical C. neoformans VNI strains, using an AMB-ECV of 0.5 microg/mL, was found. Moreover, 25 of 28 (89.3%) C. neoformans VNI strains from environmental and veterinary sources also had AMB-MICs above 0.5 microg/mL. In general, there was no significant difference in GM AMB-MIC of the clinical strains isolated from patients with (35 patients) and without (78 patients) prior AMB treatment (0.85 vs 0.76; p = 0.624). GM MIC of the environmental strains was not significantly different from that of the prior AMB-treatment strains (0.98 vs 0.76, p = 0.159) and the post-AMB-treatment strains (0.98 vs 0.85, p = 0.488). Conclusion: The high rate of non-wild-type among these otherwise naive isolates to amphotericin B is unexpected. Confirmation with more strains from a later era is needed.'),\n",

To better understand the mechanism for preterm birth among HIV-infected women, we evaluated whether mid-trimester cervical length differed by HIV status as cervical shortening is associated with an increased risk for preterm birth. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among pregnant women receiving care at the Scottish Livingstone Hospital in Molepolole, Botswana. Consecutive women referred for routine obstetrical ultrasound were consented and enrolled if between 22w0d and 24w6d by ultrasound biometry. Blinded to maternal HIV status, an obstetrician measured transvaginal cervical length using standardized criteria. Cervical length, as well as the proportion of women with a short cervix (<25mm), were compared among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The acceptability of transvaginal ultrasound was also evaluated. RESULTS: Between April 2016 and April 2017, 853 women presenting for obstetric ultrasound were screened, 187 (22%) met eligibility criteria, and 179 (96%) were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 50 (28%) were HIV-infected (86% on antiretroviral therapy), 127 (71%) were HIV-uninfected, and 2 (1%) had unknown HIV status. There was no significant difference in mean cervical length between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women (32mm vs 31mm, p = 0.21), or in the proportion with a short cervix (10% vs 14%, p = 0.44). Acceptability data was available for 115 women who underwent a transvaginal ultrasound exam. Of these, 112 of 115 (97%) women deemed the transvaginal scan acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of preterm birth observed among HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral therapy in Botswana is unlikely associated with mid-trimester cervical shortening.

Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, has been found to benefit microbiota composition, promote gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation in human and animal models of diabetes. Inspired by the effect of metformin on diabetes-related gut dysbiosis, we herein critically review the relevance of metformin to control inflammation in PLWH.

Although integrated retroviral DNA, known as a provirus, can be found at many sites in the host genome, integration is not random. The adaption of linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) protocols for high-throughput integration site mapping, using randomly-sheared genomic DNA and Illumina paired-end sequencing, has dramatically increased the number of mapped integration sites. Analysis of samples from human donors has shown that there is clonal expansion of HIV infected cells and that clonal expansion makes an important contribution to HIV persistence. However, analysis of HIV integration sites in samples taken from patients requires extensive PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing, which makes the methodology prone to certain specific artifacts. RESULTS: To address the problems with artifacts, we use a comprehensive approach involving experimental procedures linked to a bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Using this combined approach, we are able to reduce the number of PCR/sequencing artifacts that arise and identify the ones that remain. Our streamlined workflow combines random cleavage of the DNA in the samples, end repair, and linker ligation in a single step. We provide guidance on primer and linker design that reduces some of the common artifacts. We also discuss how to identify and remove some of the common artifacts, including the products of PCR mispriming and PCR recombination, that have appeared in some published studies. Our improved bioinformatics pipeline rapidly parses the sequencing data and identifies bona fide integration sites in clonally expanded cells, producing an Excel-formatted report that can be used for additional data processing. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a detailed protocol that reduces the prevalence of artifacts that arise in the analysis of retroviral integration site data generated from in vivo samples and a bioinformatics pipeline that is able to remove the artifacts that remain.'),\n",

Methods: Study participants consisted of 120 crack cocaine-using participants in a larger community-based HIV/STD prevention and research program targeting at-risk African-Americans. They were required to return for a series of four booster health education sessions over 2-5 days and 6 month and 1 year follow-up assessments. The most difficult aspect of this program was no-shows for the second booster session; study participants who attended at least two sessions were much more likely to attend all sessions and complete the entire lengthy program. The program director randomly approached some participants after the first visit in a public setting and briefly touched them as part of a handshake; then, the director asked them to return for their follow-up sessions. Whether they were approached or not was random. Analysis comprised descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Results: Ninety-three percent of participants who were asked to return and were touched returned for the second session; only 75% returned who had been asked to do so but were not touched. A statistically significant difference favored being touched and complying, as measured by second-session returning participants (p < .01), though it appeared the touch / request had more of a preventive than a promotional effect. Extraneous demographic and background factors were ruled out with the exception of age (older participants), which contributed slightly. Conclusions: Results suggest that a request \"anchored\" to a socially acceptable public touch is promising in terms of improving program participation and engagement.

The authors examined cardiac structure and function in PHIV+ adolescents on ART compared with HIV-uninfected (HIV-) adolescents. METHODS: Echocardiography was performed on PHIV+ and age- and sex-frequency-matched HIV- adolescents enrolled in the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort. Participants were eligible if they were 9 to 14 years of age and had been on ART for >/=6 months. RESULTS: Overall, 474 PHIV+ adolescents (median age, 12 years; 51% boys; mean age at ART initiation, 5 years) and 109 HIV- adolescents (median age, 11.8 years; 45% boys) were included. The mean duration on ART was 7 years, with 37% starting treatment before 2 years of age. Compared with HIV- adolescents, PHIV+ adolescents had higher median Z scores for left ventricular (LV) internal end-diastolic dimension, LV end-systolic posterior wall thickness, and end-systolic interventricular septal thickness. PHIV+ adolescents had a lower median Z score for right ventricular internal end-diastolic dimension as compared with HIV- adolescents. There was no difference in ejection fraction or diastolic function between groups. Later initiation of ART (after 6 years) was associated with increased risk for LV hypertrophy (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.6; P = .01) compared with those who started ART earlier. PHIV+ adolescents with World Health Organization stage IV HIV infection were at increased risk (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0-4.6; P = .05) of having LV diastolic dysfunction compared with those with less advanced clinical disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed subtle differences in echocardiographic parameters between PHIV+ and HIV- adolescents. Although these were not clinically significant, starting ART at an older age was a significant risk factor for LV hypertrophy, while more advanced clinical disease was associated with LV diastolic dysfunction.'),\n",

Because sequences of antibodies isolated from the fusion peptide (FP)-targeting VRC34-antibody lineage suggested it might be suitable for such rare mutation analysis, we carried out next-generation sequencing (NGS) on B cell transcripts from donor N123, the source of the VRC34 lineage, and functionally and structurally characterized inferred intermediates along broadly neutralizing and poorly neutralizing developmental branches. The broadly neutralizing VRC34.01 branch required the rare heavy-chain mutation Y33P to bind FP, whereas the early bifurcated VRC34.05 branch did not require this rare mutation and evolved less breadth.

Stigma and criminalization create barriers to health-care engagement and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), potentially promoting the development of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). We evaluated transmitted, pre-treatment and acquired HIVDR among MSM and TGW in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. METHODS: Adults with HIV RNA >/=1,000 copies/ml in the TRUST/RV368 cohort, including incident cases diagnosed via 3-monthly screening, underwent HIVDR testing using the Sanger sequencing method. Major mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) were identified from the 2017 IAS-USA list. World Health Organization surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were identified in ART-naive participants. RESULTS: From March 2013 to June 2017, 415 participants with median age 24 (interquartile range [IQR] 21-27) years, CD4(+) T-cell count 370 (IQR 272-502) cells/mm(3), and HIV RNA 4.73 (IQR 4.26-5.15) log10 copies/ml underwent HIVDR testing.

In HIV-1 positive women anti-HIV-1 responses are associated with transmission risk, however detailed investigation into both HIV-1-specific memory responses associated with HIV-1 control and T-cell subset changes during pregnancy have not been undertaken. In this study we aimed to define pregnancy and gestation related changes to HIV-1-specific responses and T-cell phenotype in ART treated HIV-1 positive pregnant women. Eleven non-pregnant and 24 pregnant HIV-1 positive women were recruited, peripheral blood samples taken, fresh cells isolated, and compared using ELISpot assays and flow cytometry analysis. Clinical data were collected as part of standard care, and non-parametric statistics used. Alterations in induced IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-10, and granzyme B secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to HIV-1 Gag and Nef peptide pools and changes in T-cell subsets between pregnant and non-pregnant women were assessed, with data correlated with participant clinical parameters and longitudinal analysis performed. Cross-sectional comparison identified decreased IL-10 Nef response in HIV-1 positive pregnant women compared to non-pregnant, while correlations exhibited reversed Gag and Nef cytokine and protease response associations between groups. Longitudinal analysis of pregnant participants demonstrated transient increases in Gag granzyme B response and in the central memory CD4 T-cell subset frequency during their second trimester, with a decrease in CD4 effector memory T cells from their second to third trimester. Gag and Nef HIV-1-specific responses diverge with pregnancy time-point, coinciding with relevant T-cell phenotype, and gestation associated immunological adaptations. Decreased IL-10 Nef and both increased granzyme B Gag response and central memory CD4 T cells implies that amplified antigen production is occurring, which suggests a period of compromised HIV-1 control in pregnancy.'),\n",

Methods: We surveyed 1886 women aged >/= 18 years from Haiphong, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City who had sold sex in the last month. We tested for HCV antibody and HCV core antigen as markers for exposure to HCV and active infection, respectively. Results: Across these provinces, high prevalence of HCV exposure (8.8-30.4%) and active infection (3.6-22.1%) were observed. Significant associations with HCV exposure were HIV infection (aOR = 23.7; 95% CI: 14.8-37.9), injection drug use (aOR = 23.3; 95% CI: 13.1-41.4), history of compulsory detention (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4-4.2) and having more than 10 sex clients in the last month (aOR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.2).

The objective of this review was to identify health care provider barriers to PrEP implementation. A systematic review was conducted in February 2019 using PubMed to identify barriers to PrEP prescribing practices in the United States. Targeted search terms surrounding PrEP and providers resulted in 222 original studies, 28 of which were ultimately included in our review, with data collected between 2011 and 2018. Six themes were identified across reviewed studies: (i) a lack of PrEP knowledge, (ii) the presence of the Purview Paradox, which refers to discordance in beliefs between HIV specialists and primary care providers on who should prescribe PrEP, (iii) concerns about PrEP costs, (iv) concerns about behavioral and health consequences, (v) interpersonal stigma, and (vi) concerns about patient adherence. A majority of providers were lacking knowledge regarding PrEP, resulting in discomfort in prescribing PrEP, or limited awareness and understanding of PrEP clinical guidelines. Discrepant opinions were identified regarding whether PrEP was best managed within primary care or specialty clinics. Other barriers included concerns about cost, patient adherence, and follow-up maintenance care. Finally, concerns about risk compensation and discomfort discussing sexual activities with patients who would benefit most from PrEP were apparent. Additional work is needed to prepare providers to prescribe and manage patients on PrEP, optimize PrEP delivery, and reduce provider bias. Future research is needed to identify providers' attitudes and beliefs regarding innovations in PrEP dosing, task shifting, and novel strategies for PrEP care.\"),\n",

We interviewed 458 women accessing HIV-care at the three tertiary hospitals in Ogun State, Nigeria. Trained research assistants conducted 10-min structured interviews with validated questionnaires. We carried out descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses. We used the backward elimination technique to build a model to predict the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) within the preceding 12 months. We set the level of significance at .05. A total of 23 (5.02%) participants reported IPV within the preceding 12 months, while the prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence was 24.02%. Younger age, the experience of IPV in previous relationships, and having multiple sex partners were related to the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months (p < .05). Also, the partners' age, alcohol intake, and current smoking status were associated with the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months (p < .05). After regression analysis, participants' age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.892, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.831, 0.957]), experience of IPV in previous relationship (AOR = 12.841, 95% CI = [4.303, 38.318]), and partners' current smoking status (AOR = 4.874, 95% CI = [1.252, 18.969]) retained association with the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months.

In this paper, binding free energies between two HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) proteases and four inhibitors are calculated by molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) combined with the newly developed interaction entropy (IE) approach. The internal dielectric constant is set on the basis of different types of amino acids. The entropy change in protein-ligand binding is computed by IE method which is superior to the traditional normal mode (Nmode) method in the analysis of the ranking of binding free energy, statistical stability and enthalpy-entropy compensation. Importantly, IE method combined with alanine scanning is applied to calculate residue-specific binding free energy. And the calculated total binding free energy using the current method is in excellent with the experimental observed. Our research indicates that HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases share the common hot-spot residues with ILE50/50' and ILE84/ILE84' which provide the major favorable contribution to the binding of protein and inhibitor in all systems. The predicted hot-spot residues are more in HIV-1 complex than HIV-2 complex and some hot-spot residues contributing to HIV-1 don't play a significant role in HIV-2. To some extent, this explains the reason of decrease in potency inhibitors against HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 protease. The study is expected to understand quantitatively the binding mechanism of HIV-inhibitor and provide important theoretical guidance for the design of equipotent HIV-1/HIV-2 protease inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

SETTING: Adult HIV clinic cohort in Nashville, Tennessee, between 1998 and 2015. METHODS: PLWH with >/=1 year of follow-up in the clinic were assessed for cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome (any 3 of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or obesity), chronic kidney and liver disease, non-AIDS-defining cancers, and dementia. Only mood disorders documented during the first year of care were included. Cumulative incidence and adjusted subhazard ratios (aSHRs) were calculated for risk of NCDs and multimorbidity with death as a competing risk. Multivariable Cox models estimated mortality risk after multimorbidity. RESULTS: Of 4140 adults, 24% had a mood disorder diagnosed in the first year of care, 51% had >/=1 NCD at baseline, and there were 2588 incident NCDs during the study period.

Applying social-cognitive theory, we examined a longitudinal sequential path model of the association between depressive symptoms and viral nonsuppression in women with HIV (WWH) through these mediating mechanisms. METHODS: This was an observational longitudinal study using data from the Women's Adherence and Visit Engagement substudy of the Women's Interagency HIV Study. WWH (N = 375) completed measures of depressive symptoms, adherence self-efficacy, and ART adherence. Viral load was measured through blood draw. We examined a longitudinal sequential path model spanning 3 time points at least 6 months apart between 2015 and 2017. Indirect effects were assessed of depressive symptoms at time 1 (T1) on viral nonsuppression at T3 through adherence self-efficacy at T2 and ART adherence at T3. Covariates included age, income, recreational drug use, race, and months on ART. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were associated with subsequent viral nonsuppression through its association with adherence self-efficacy and ART adherence [indirect effect: adjusted odds ratio = 1.004, 95% confidence interval: (1.001 to 1.008)]. Months on ART and recreational drug use were also significantly associated with viral nonsuppression at T3. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support depressive symptoms' association with adherence self-efficacy that in turn lead to suboptimal ART adherence and ultimately to viral nonsuppression for WWH. Tailoring of interventions aimed at addressing depressive symptoms, substance use, and adherence self-efficacy among WWH is needed to help close the gap between ART prescription and viral suppression on the HIV care continuum.\"),\n",

       "  'INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to identify the profiles of young people who use drugs (YPUD) and their exposure to HIV risks in the 3 main cities of Vietnam, Haiphong, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), in order to design a community-based intervention to prevent HIV. METHODS: A survey using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was conducted among YPUD aged 16-24. Participants were eligible if they reported drug use, confirmed by a urine test. After obtaining informed consent, they were screened for HIV/HCV and assessed using face-to-face questionnaires and self-report. A cluster analysis was conducted, taking into account risk behaviors and confirmed HIV-positive status. RESULTS: Seven hundred and three YPUD aged 16-24 were recruited between October 2016 and February 2017, 584 of whom were included in the final analysis. Median age was 21 (17.7, 23.0); 79% were male, 18% female, and 2% transgender. Methamphetamines use was reported by 77%, followed by cannabis (51%) and heroin (17%); polydrug use was common; 15% had \"ever\" injected drugs. HIV prevalence was 7%. Among all participants, 48% reported non-consistent condom use and 1% reported needle/syringe sharing during the previous month. Four distinct profiles of HIV risk behaviors were identified: The high multiple-risk group mixed unsafe drug use with unsafe sexual practices and had higher prevalence of HIV; the second group practiced high-risk sex with non-consistent condom combined with methamphetamine use; the third group was a moderate-risk group with limited unsafe sexual practices; and the fourth was considered at \"low-risk\" as reportedly, most never had sex and never injected. The highest risk group included more female YPUD, living in HCMC, who used heroin and had unsafe sex with their regular partners. The second high-risk group included most of the MSM and all transgender people and frequently reported mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The profiles of YPUD who are at risk of HIV vary according to age, location, and population group. Injecting YPUD are the most exposed to risk and need immediate attention. Sexual exposure to HIV is very common. Mental health is a major concern. Interventions need to be integrated in a differentiated but holistic approach.'),\n",

This study uses a social network modeling methodology to identify aspects of the social environment that are not often described, that is, the places and spaces or \"venues\" where YBMSM socialize or where they receive HIV prevention services. In particular, we identify the structural features of avoidance of these venues as an indicator of negative experiences, using bipartite exponential random graph models. Our study theorizes that YBMSM avoid certain venues en masse through information diffusion among social network members. We specify two social mechanisms of collective venue avoidance-(1) homophily (i.e., ego-alter similarity in venue avoidance) and (2) popular opinion leaders (as early adopters)-and test the corresponding hypotheses that (Hypothesis 1) socially connected individuals avoid venues together and that (Hypothesis 2) popular individuals would be more likely to avoid venues. Based on data collected from YBMSM aged 16 to 29 years between 2014 and 2016 in Houston, Texas (N = 227) and Chicago, Illinois (N = 241), results indicate that Hypothesis 1 was supported in both cities but that Hypothesis 2 was supported only in Chicago. The findings suggest that the structural patterns of venue avoidance are different between cities and may inform dissemination of prevention messages and delivery of venue- and social influence-based HIV interventions.'),\n",

Previous research has not examined the buffering effect of PTG on the association between DA and quality of life. Therefore, in addition to the direct effects of DA and PTG on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), we investigated the moderating role of PTG on the relationship between DA and HRQoL among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in Nigeria. Using cross-sectional design and availability sampling method, we selected 201 outpatients (men, n = 63, 31.3%, women, n = 138, 68.7%, mean age = 40.1, SD = 10.5) managed for HIV/AIDS in a Nigerian tertiary healthcare institution. Death Anxiety Inventory-Revised, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form, and Patient-Reported Outcome Quality of Life-HIV were used to access DA, PTG and HRQoL, respectively. Results showed that while adjusting for socio-demographic factors (age, gender, time since diagnosis and educational status), DA was associated with physical health, mental health and social relationships domains of HRQoL as well as overall HRQoL. In contrast, PTG did not evidence significant association with HRQoL dimensions and overall HRQoL. The moderation effect of PTG on the association between DA and HRQoL was not supported. Independent of PTG, alleviating DA may be an important target in terms of therapeutic intervention towards improving quality life of PLWH.'),\n",

Approaches that force HIV transcription from these cells, making them susceptible to killing-termed kick and kill regimens-have been explored as a strategy towards an HIV cure. RIVER is the first randomised trial to determine the effect of ART-only versus ART plus kick and kill on markers of the HIV reservoir. METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial was undertaken at six clinical sites in the UK. Patients aged 18-60 years who were confirmed as HIV-positive within a maximum of the past 6 months and started ART within 1 month from confirmed diagnosis were randomly assigned by a computer generated randomisation list to receive ART-only (control) or ART plus the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (the kick) and replication-deficient viral vector T-cell inducing vaccines encoding conserved HIV sequences ChAdV63. HIVconsv-prime and MVA.HIVconsv-boost (the kill; ART + V + V; intervention). The primary endpoint was total HIV DNA isolated from peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells at weeks 16 and 18 after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02336074. FINDINGS: Between June 14, 2015 and Jul 11, 2017, 60 men with HIV were randomly assigned to receive either an ART-only (n=30) or an ART + V + V (n=30) regimen; all 60 participants completed the study, with no loss-to-follow-up. Mean total HIV DNA at weeks 16 and 18 after randomisation was 3.02 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in the ART-only group versus 3.06 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in ART + V + V group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (mean difference of 0.04 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells [95% CI -0.03 to 0.11; p=0.26]). There were no intervention-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: This kick and kill approach conferred no significant benefit compared with ART alone on measures of the HIV reservoir. Although this does not disprove the efficacy kick and kill strategy, for future trials enhancement of both kick and kill agents will be required.

Previous statistical simulations indicate these trials may be partially protective. In that case, it will be crucial to identify the mechanism of breakthrough infections. To that end, we developed a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the AMP trials and infer the breakthrough mechanisms using measurable trial outcomes. This framework combines viral dynamics with antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and will be generally applicable to forthcoming bNAb prevention trials. We fit our model to human viral load data (RV217). Then, we incorporated VRC01 neutralization using serum pharmacokinetics (HVTN 104) and in vitro pharmacodynamics (LANL CATNAP database). We systematically explored trial outcomes by reducing in vivo potency and varying the distribution of sensitivity to VRC01 in circulating strains. We found trial outcomes could be used in a clinical trial regression model (CTRM) to reveal whether partially protective trials were caused by large fractions of VRC01-resistant (IC50>50 mug/mL) circulating strains or rather a global reduction in VRC01 potency against all strains. The former mechanism suggests the need to enhance neutralizing antibody breadth; the latter suggests the need to enhance VRC01 delivery and/or in vivo binding. We will apply the clinical trial regression model to data from the completed trials to help optimize future approaches for passive delivery of anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies.'),\n",

However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have implicated contemporary ART regimens, including use of integrase strand transfer inhibitors and tenofovir alafenamide, as a contributor to weight gain, though the mechanisms are unclear. Metabolic dysregulation is linked to ectopic fat and alterations in adipose immune cell populations that accompany HIV and obesity.

The outcome of previous immunogenicity studies suggests that the limited accessibility of the CD4bs and the presence of predominant nonneutralizing determinants (nND) on Env may impede the elicitation of bNAbs and their precursors by vaccination. In this study, we designed a panel of novel immunogens that 1) preferentially expose the CD4bs by selective elimination of glycosylation sites flanking the CD4bs, and 2) minimize the nND immune response by engineering fusion proteins consisting of gp120 Core and one or two CD4-induced (CD4i) mAbs for masking nND epitopes, referred to as gp120-CD4i fusion proteins. As expected, the fusion proteins possess improved antigenicity with retained affinity for VRC01-class, CD4bs-directed bNAbs and dampened affinity for nonneutralizing Abs. We immunized C57BL/6 mice with these fusion proteins and found that overall the fusion proteins elicit more focused CD4bs Ab response than prototypical gp120 Core by serological analysis. Consistently, we found that mice immunized with selected gp120-CD4i fusion proteins have higher frequencies of germinal center-activated B cells and CD4bs-directed memory B cells than those inoculated with parental immunogens. We isolated three mAbs from mice immunized with selected gp120-CD4i fusion proteins and found that their footprints on Env are similar to VRC01-class bNAbs.

However, some PLWH experience virologic rebound after a period of viral suppression, usually followed by selection of drug resistant virus. Determining factors associated with drug resistance can inform patient management and healthcare policies, particularly in resource-limited settings where drug resistance testing is not routine. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted using data captured from an electronic medical record in a large treatment program in Nigeria.

Poorer working memory performance relates to alterations in specific brain networks. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined if there was a relationship between brain networks involved in working memory and reported level of alcohol consumption during an individual's period of heaviest use. Furthermore, we examined whether HIV status and the interaction between HIV and alcohol consumption was associated with differences in these brain networks. METHODS: Fifty adults, 26 of whom were HIV positive, engaged in an n-back working memory task (0-back and 2-back trials) administered in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The Kreek- McHugh-Schluger-Kellogg (KMSK) scale of alcohol consumption was used to characterize an individual's period of heaviest use and correlates well with their risk for alcohol dependence. Connectivity analyses were conducted using data collected during n-back task. RESULTS: Functional connectivity differences associated with greater alcohol consumption included negative connectivity, primarily from parietal attention networks to frontal networks. Greater alcohol consumption was also associated with positive connectivity from working memory nodes to the precuneus and paracingulate. HIV positive status was associated with more nodes of negative functional connectivity relative to alcohol consumption history alone, particularly in the frontoparietal networks. The HIV positive individuals with heavier drinking history related to negative fronto-parietal connectivity, along with positive connectivity from working memory nodes to mesolimbic regions.

To test this hypothesis, we enrolled a cohort of 70 PLWH (44% hypertensive) on a long-term single antiretroviral therapy regimen for broad phenotyping of inflammation biomarkers. We found that hypertensive PLWH had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1, interleukin-6, interleukin-17, interleukin-5, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. After adjustment for age, sex, and fat mass index, the circulating eosinophils remained significantly associated with hypertension. On the basis of these results, we assessed the relationship of eosinophils and hypertension in 2 cohorts of 50 and 81 039 similar HIV-negative people; although eosinophil count was associated with prevalent hypertension, this relationship was abrogated by body mass index. Conclusions These findings may represent a unique linkage between immune status and cardiovascular physiological characteristics in HIV infection, which should be evaluated further.'),\n",

       "  'INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines have shifted over time to recommend earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and now encourage ART initiation on the day of HIV diagnosis, if possible. However, barriers to ART access may delay initiation in resource-limited settings. We characterized temporal trends and other factors influencing the interval between HIV diagnosis and ART initiation among participants enrolled in a clinic-based cohort across four African countries. METHODS: The African Cohort Study enrols adults engaged in care at 12 sites in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. Participants provide a medical history, complete a physical examination and undergo laboratory assessments every six months. Participants with recorded dates of HIV diagnosis were categorized by WHO guideline era (<2006, 2006 to 2009, 2010 to 2012, 2013 to 2015, >/=2016) at the time of diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for time to ART initiation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From January 2013 to September 2019, a total of 2888 adults living with HIV enrolled with known diagnosis dates. Median time to ART initiation decreased from 22.0 months (interquartile range (IQR) 4.0 to 77.3) among participants diagnosed prior to 2006 to 0.5 months (IQR 0.2 to 1.8) among those diagnosed in 2016 and later. Comparing those same periods, CD4 nadir increased from a median of 166 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 81 to 286) to 298 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 151 to 501). In the final adjusted model, participants diagnosed in each subsequent WHO guideline era had increased rates of ART initiation compared to those diagnosed before 2006. CD4 nadir >/=500 cells/mm(3) was independently associated with a lower rate of ART initiation as compared to CD4 nadir <200 cells/mm(3) (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.37). Age >50 years at diagnosis was independently associated with shorter time to ART initiation as compared to 18 to 29 years (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with changing guidelines, the interval between diagnosis and ART initiation has decreased over time. Still, many adults living with HIV initiated treatment with low CD4, highlighting the need to diagnose HIV earlier while improving access to immediate ART after diagnosis.'),\n",

Integrating recency testing into routine HIV testing services (HTS) can provide important information on transmission clusters and prioritize clients for partner testing. This study assessed the feasibility and use of integrating HIV recency into routine testing. METHODS: We conducted a multi-method study at 14 facilities in Kenya, and key informant interviews with health care providers. We abstracted clinical record data, collected specimens, tested specimens for recent infection, returned results to participants, and conducted a follow-up survey for those recently infected. RESULTS: From March to October 2018, we enrolled 532 clients who were diagnosed HIV-positive for the first time. Of these, 46 (8.6%) were recently infected. Women aged 15-24 years had 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.46 to 5.78) times higher adjusted odds of recent infection compared with 15-24-year-old men and those tested within the past 12 months having 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 4.70) times higher adjusted odds compared with those tested >/=12 months previously. Fourteen of 17 providers interviewed found the integration of recency testing into routine HTS services acceptable and feasible. Among clients who completed the follow-up interview, most (92%) felt that the recency results were useful. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating recent infection testing into routine HTS services in Kenya is feasible and largely acceptable to clients and providers. More studies should be done on possible physical and social harms related to returning results, and the best uses of the recent infection data at an individual and population level.'),\n",

METHODS: From five health facilities in the Kweneng East District, 1,022 women aged 30-49 years were enrolled to self-collect their cervicovaginal specimen for hrHPV testing by the Xpert HPV Test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Crude and age group-adjusted hrHPV prevalence by HIV status were calculated, and the relationship of hrHPV risk groups HPV16>HPV18/45>other hrHPV types) to the presence and severity of visible lesions. RESULTS: Of the 1,022 women enrolled, 1,019 (99.7%), 570 WLWH and 449 HIV-negative women, had hrHPV testing results. Crude hrHPV prevalences were 25.2% (95%CI = 21.2-29.4%) for HIV-negative women and 40.4% (95%CI = 36.3-44.5%) for WLWH. Age group-adjusted hrHPV prevalences were 23.7% (95%CI = 19.9-27.9%) for HIV-negative women and 41.3% (95%CI = 37.2-45.4%) for WLWH. Age group-adjusted prevalences of HPV16 (p<0.001), HPV18/45 (p<0.001), HPV31/33/35/52/58 (p<0.001), and HPV39/56/66/68 (p = 0.011) were greater among WLWH than HIV-negative women. Riskier hrHPV groups were more likely to have visible abnormalities (ptrend = 0.004) and visible abnormalities not eligible for cryotherapy (ptrend = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: hrHPV infection was common among all women in the study living in Botswana, to a greater extent in WLWH than their HIV-negative counterparts.

Translating evidence-based interventions such as these to scale requires an implementation science approach. METHODS: A qualitative study evaluating health care providers' perceptions of barriers and facilitators of a previously completed financial incentives intervention for pediatric HIV testing was conducted at health care facilities in Kisumu, Kenya. Six focus group discussions with 52 providers explored determinants of acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of financial incentive scale-up for pediatric HIV testing using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to inform question guides and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Providers found the use of financial incentive interventions for pediatric HIV testing to be highly acceptable. First, providers believed financial incentives had a relative advantage over existing strategies, because they overcame cost barriers and provided additional motivation to test; however, concerns about how financial incentives would be implemented influenced perceptions of feasibility and sustainability. Second, providers expressed concern that already overburdened staff and high costs of financial incentive programs would limit sustainability. Third, providers feared that financial incentives may negatively affect further care because of expectations of repeated financial support and program manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: Providers viewed financial incentives as an acceptable intervention to scale programmatically to increase uptake of pediatric testing. To ensure feasibility and sustainability of financial incentives in pediatric HIV testing programs, it will be important to clearly define target populations, manage expectations of continued financial support, and establish systems to track testing.\"),\n",

Currently, there is limited information on the circulating HIV-1 strains, the distribution of these strains and antiretroviral (ART) resistant viruses in different regions of the country, and the HIV-1 strains harbored by the high-risk groups like female sex workers (FSW) reported to be the source of recombinant and ART resistant viruses. METHODS: Dried Blood Spots (DBS), collected from 325 infected FSWs in ten cities from 2012 DRC HIV/STI Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey, were tested for HIV-1 genotypes and antiretroviral resistance mutations. Regional segregation of HIV-1 clades was detected using phylogenetics. The significance for differences in HIV-1 subtype and drug resistance mutations were evaluated using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: There were 145 (env) and 93 (pol) sequences analyzed. Based on env sequences, the predominant subtype was A1 (44%), and recombinants as defined pol sequences comprised 35% of the total sample. Paired sequences of pol and env from DRC FSW revealed mosaic recombinant in 54% of the sequences. Distinct geographic distributions of different HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants were observed. Subtype A1 was prevalent (40%) in Goma located in the East and significantly higher than in Mbuji-Mayi (p<0.05) in the South-central region, or in Lubumbashi in the South. Antiretroviral resistance was detected in 21.5% of 93 pol sequences analyzed, with the M184I/V and K103N mutations that confer high-level resistance to NRTI and NNRTI, respectively, being the most frequent mutations. However, the K103N mutant viruses were found only in the East. CONCLUSION: HIV-1 variants found in DRC FSW reflect those reported to circulate in the general population from the corresponding geographical locations. HIV-1 mosaic genetics were readily detected in FSW. Importantly, ART resistance mutations to NNRTI and NRTI were common in the DRC sex workers.'),\n",

We reviewed studies of people living in sub-Saharan Africa coinfected with HIV and Schistosoma spp. between January 1996 and July 2018. We found that 1) infection with Schistosoma haematobium increases the risk of HIV acquisition, 2) there is currently a lack of data on whether HIV infection increases the risk of Schistosoma acquisition, 3a) HIV coinfection was not an accelerating factor for adverse Schistosoma outcomes, 3b) schistosomiasis may be an important contributor to immune activation in HIV coinfected people, 4) praziquantel use in coinfected people may improve immune reconstitution on antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and 5) there is evidence that HIV infection reduces egg excretion in individuals infected with Schistosoma mansoni.'),\n",

Dendritic cells (DCs) detect viral infections via cytosolic RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5 leading to MAVS-induced immunity. The DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 senses abortive human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) transcripts and induces MAVS-dependent type I interferon (IFN) responses, suggesting that abortive HIV-1 RNA transcripts induce antiviral immunity. Little is known about the induction of antiviral immunity by DDX3-ligand abortive HIV-1 RNA. Here we synthesized a 58 nucleotide-long capped RNA (HIV-1 Cap-RNA58) that mimics abortive HIV-1 RNA transcripts. HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 induced potent type I IFN responses in monocyte-derived DCs, monocytes, macrophages and primary CD1c(+) DCs. Compared with RLR agonist poly-I:C, HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 induced comparable levels of type I IFN responses, identifying HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 as a potent trigger of antiviral immunity. In monocyte-derived DCs, HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 activated the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappaB. Moreover, HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 induced DC maturation and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. HIV-1 Cap-RNA58-stimulated DCs induced proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and differentiated naive T helper (TH) cells toward a TH2 phenotype. Importantly, treatment of DCs with HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 resulted in an efficient antiviral innate immune response that reduced ongoing HIV-1 replication in DCs. Our data strongly suggest that HIV-1 Cap-RNA58 induces potent innate and adaptive immune responses, making it an interesting addition in vaccine design strategies.'),\n",

To date, no validated instrument exists to measure patients' experiences of HCV stigma. This study aimed to revise the Berger (2001) HIV stigma scale and evaluate its psychometric properties among patients with HCV infection. METHODS: The Berger HIV stigma scale was revised to ask about HCV and administered to patients with HCV (n = 270) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Scale reliability was evaluated as internal consistency by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to evaluate construct validity by comparing item clustering to the Berger HIV stigma scale subscales. Item response theory was employed to further evaluate individual items and to calibrate items for simulated computer adaptive testing sessions in order to identify potential shortened instruments. RESULTS: The revised HCV Stigma Scale was found to have good reliability (alpha = 0.957). After excluding items for low loadings, the exploratory factor analysis indicated good construct validity with 85% of items loading on pre-defined factors. Analyses strongly suggested the predominance of an underlying unidimensional factor solution, which yielded a 33-item scale after items were removed for low loading and differential item functioning. Adaptive simulations indicated that the scale could be substantially shortened without detectable information loss. CONCLUSIONS: The 33-item HCV Stigma Scale showed sufficient reliability and construct validity.

       "  'Introduction: Despite improvements in treatment (eg, reduction in pill intake), antiretroviral therapy (ART) is dispensed in socially inefficient and uneconomical packaging. To make pills less conspicuous and decrease the risk of being stigmatized, people living with HIV (PLWH) often engage in self-repackaging - the practice of transferring ART from original packaging to alternative containers. This behavior has been associated with ART nonadherence and failure to achieve viral load suppression. While much of the literature on ART packaging has centered around medication adherence, patients stated preferences for ART packaging and packaging attributes that influence the observed ART nonadherence are understudied. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study to elucidate perceptions of ART packaging among PLWH at two large referral hospitals in Northern Tanzania. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded. Results: Of the 16 participants whose data were used in the final analysis, a majority were between 36 and 55 years of age (Mean 45.5 years SD: 11.1), had primary-level education (n=11, 68.8%), were self-employed (n=9, 56.3%), reported that they had self-repacked ART (n=14, 88%), and were taking ART for more than 6 years (n=11, 68.8%). Participants identified three attributes of ART packaging that increased anticipated HIV stigma and prompted self-repackaging, including visual identification, bulkiness, and the rattling noise produced by ART pill bottles. Conclusion: Given the drastic reduction in the number of pills required for HIV treatment, there is an opportunity to not only assess the cost-effectiveness of innovative ART packaging but also evaluate the acceptability of such packaging among PLWH in order to address stigma and improve ART adherence.'),\n",

In New York State (NYS) outside of New York City (NYC), MSM accounted for 57% of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 2017. HIV/AIDS home testing initiatives have been effective at getting priority populations tested for HIV. OBJECTIVES: The NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) administered the HIV Home Test Giveaway (HHTG) program through social media and mobile applications popular among the priority populations to (1) promote HIV screening among gay and bisexual men, MSM, transgender (TG), and gender queer/gender nonconforming (GNC) individuals who have sex with men, and (2) identify individuals with undiagnosed HIV infection. DESIGN/SETTING: The NYSDOH recruited participants from NYS (excluding NYC) through social media campaigns between November 2016 and January 2018. Interested individuals were directed to an online eligibility survey. Eligible participants received a coupon via e-mail for a free HIV self-test (HIVST) kit through the manufacturer's Web site. Eligible participants received a $20 to $25 Amazon online gift card if they completed a voluntary online follow-up survey regarding their test results, experiences with the HHTG, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants were also able to request assistance from the NYSDOH with further testing and various prevention and supportive services. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 6190 individuals participated and 3197 (52%) were eligible and received a coupon. Of the eligible, 2022 (63%) redeemed coupons for HIVST. RESULTS: Among eligible participants, 976 (31%) reported having never been tested for HIV. On the follow-up survey, 922 (29%) participants reported having used the HIVST kit for themselves; 203 (22%) were first-time testers; and 7 (0.8%) tested HIV reactive. Of the follow-up survey participants, 761 (59%) requested assistance with various services. CONCLUSIONS: Media campaigns were effective in promoting HIV testing among priority populations and reaching individuals who have never been tested for HIV.\"),\n",

       "  'Tailoring public health responses to growing HIV transmission clusters depends on accurately mapping the risk network through which it spreads and identifying acute infections that represent the leading edge of cluster growth. HIV transmission links, especially those involving persons with acute HIV infection (AHI), can be difficult to uncover, or confirm during partner services investigations. We integrated molecular, epidemiologic, serologic and behavioral data to infer and evaluate transmission linkages between participants of a prospective study of AHI conducted in North Carolina, New York City and San Francisco from 2011-2013. Among the 547 participants with newly diagnosed HIV with polymerase sequences, 465 sex partners were reported, of whom only 35 (7.5%) had HIV sequences. Among these 35 contacts, 23 (65.7%) links were genetically supported and 12 (34.3%) were not. Only five links were reported between participants with AHI but none were genetically supported. In contrast, phylodynamic inference identified 102 unreported transmission links, including 12 between persons with AHI. Importantly, all putative transmission links between persons with AHI were found among large clusters with more than five members. Taken together, the presence of putative links between acute participants who did not name each other as contacts that are found only among large clusters underscores the potential for unobserved or undiagnosed intermediaries. Phylodynamics identified many more links than partner services alone and, if routinely and rapidly integrated, can illuminate transmission patterns not readily captured by partner services investigations.'),\n",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a nurse-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) among persons living with HIV who are failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: This study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial of CBT-AD integrated into the HIV primary care setting in South Africa. A total of 160 participants who did not achieve viral suppression from their first-line ART and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder will be randomized to receive either 8 sessions of CBT-AD or enhanced treatment as usual. Participants will be assessed for major depressive disorder using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 months. The primary outcomes are depression on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; as assessed by a blinded assessor) at the 4-month assessment and changes in ART adherence (assessed via real-time, electronic monitoring with Wisepill) between baseline and the 4-month assessment. Secondary outcomes are HIV viral load and CD4 cell count at the 12-month assessment as well as ART adherence (Wisepill) and depression (HAM-D) over follow-up (4-, 8-, and 12-month assessments). RESULTS: The trial commenced in August 2015 and recruitment began in July 2016. Enrollment was completed in June 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will inform whether an existing intervention (CBT-AD) can be effectively administered in LMIC by nurses with training and ongoing supervision. This will present unique opportunities to further explore the scale-up of a behavioral intervention to enhance ART adherence among persons living with HIV with major depression in a high-prevalence setting, to move toward achieving The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 goals.

Clinical pharmacists and pharmacies focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have demonstrated the ability to increase ARV medication adherence and subsequently have a positive effect on these lab markers. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an integrated health system specialty pharmacy service with a clinic-embedded, HIV-trained pharmacist and pharmacy technician on ARV medication adherence rate, viral load, and CD4 count. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted from August 7, 2017, to June 30, 2018, at an indigent outpatient infectious disease clinic within Atrium Health (AH), a not-for-profit health system based in Charlotte, NC. The intervention group (opt-in group) received HIV patient care that involved the health system specialty pharmacy service. Once a patient was enrolled in the specialty pharmacy service, medication reconciliation was completed by the pharmacist, financial assistance and prior authorizations were completed if needed; prescriptions were delivered to the patient; and monthly refills calls were conducted to assess adherence, tolerability, and medication changes. The control group (opt-out group) received HIV patient care that did not incorporate the health system specialty pharmacy. The primary endpoints were medication adherence, viral suppression, and CD4 counts. Within-group comparisons from baseline to follow-up were made along with group-to-group comparisons. Adherence was calculated using medication possession ratio. RESULTS: For those patients using Atrium Health Specialty Pharmacy Service (AH SPS; n = 46), the overall median adherence rate was higher at 100% versus only 94% for those patients (n = 50) that opted out of the service (P < 0.01). All but 3 patients (21.7% at baseline vs. 6.5% at follow-up, P = 0.03) using AH SPS reached viral suppression, and all but 1 had improved immune function with a CD4 count of 200 or greater by the end of the observation period (P = 0.03). The change in viral suppression and CD4 count of 200 or greater was not statistically improved between baseline and follow-up in those opting out of using AH SPS. When comparing the 2 groups at reaching these endpoints, there was no statistically significant difference in viral suppression and CD4 count. CONCLUSIONS: AH SPS was able to demonstrate improved ARV adherence in those patients using an integrated specialty pharmacy with an embedded pharmacy team, coordinated monthly medication delivery, and refill reminder and adherence calls. This in turn led to improved viral suppression and immune markers by the end of the observation window for patients using AH SPS. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

Their mortality compared with those with bacteriologic testing is uncertain. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study among PWH >/=15 years of age initiating TB treatment at sites affiliated with 4 International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS consortium regions from 2012 to 2014: Caribbean, Central and South America, and Central, East, and West Africa. The exposure of interest was the TB bacteriologic test status at TB treatment initiation: positive, negative, or no test result. The hazard of death in the 12 months after TB treatment initiation was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model. Missing covariate values were multiply imputed. Results: In 2091 PWH, median age 36 years, 53% had CD4 counts </=200 cells/mm(3), and 52% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at TB treatment initiation. The adjusted hazard of death was higher in patients with no test compared with those with positive test results (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.26). The hazard of death was also higher among those with negative compared with positive tests but was not statistically significant (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.91-1.81). Being on ART, having a higher CD4 count, and tertiary facility level were associated with a lower hazard for death. Conclusions: There was some evidence that PWH treated for TB with no bacteriologic test results were at higher risk of death than those with positive tests.

HIV Tat protein is known to be a major pathogenic factor for HIV/neuroAIDS through a myriad of direct and indirect mechanisms. However, most, if not all of studies involve short-time exposure of recombinant Tat protein in vitro or short-term Tat expression in vivo. In this study, we took advantage of the doxycycline-inducible brain-specific HIV-1 Tat transgenic mouse model, fed the animals for 12 months, and assessed behavioral, pathological, and epigenetic changes in these mice. Long-term Tat expression led to poorer short-and long-term memory, lower locomotor activity and impaired coordination and balance ability, increased astrocyte activation and compromised neuronal integrity, and decreased global genomic DNA methylation. There were sex- and brain region-dependent differences in behaviors, pathologies, and epigenetic changes resulting from long-term Tat expression. All these changes are reminiscent of accelerated aging, raising the possibility that HIV Tat contributes, at least in part, to HIV infection-associated accelerated aging in HIV-infected individuals. These findings also suggest another utility of this model for HIV infection-associated accelerated aging studies.'),\n",

       "  'To date, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has played an important role in the management of pregnant HIV patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Historically, in pregnant women living with HIV, the third agent in triple therapy has been either non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors (PIs). PIs have been the preferred agents because of their robustness from the perspective of viral resistance and the dominant drug class for the management of HIV during pregnancy for the previous decade. As with many drugs used during pregnancy, pharmacokinetic changes decrease exposure to these agents as the pregnancy progresses. This can lead to viral escape at the time of pregnancy and ultimately increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. TDM has been well-established for this class of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and appropriate dose adjustment studies have been performed. At present, there is a shift from the traditional treatment paradigm in pregnancy to a new drug class, integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Although INSTIs are affected by pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy, they do not harbor the same issues with viral escape as seen with PIs at birth and in general eliminate the need for boosting with additional agents like ritonavir (r) and cobicistat (c) [bar elvitegravir (EVG)] that can lead to interactions with treatment of other common infections in HIV, including tuberculosis. Furthermore, INSTIs are the most successful medication for rapidly reducing the viral load (VL) in HIV patients, a useful factor where VL may be unknown, or in late presenters. These merits make INSTIs the best choice in pregnancy, although their use has been hindered in recent years by a report of neural tube defects from a large African study with dolutegravir (DTG). New data from Botswana and Brazil indicate that this risk is less significant than previously reported, necessitating further data to shed light on this critical issue. Current international guidelines including DHHS, EACS, WHO, and BHIVA (for patients with VLs >100,000 copies/mL or late presenters) now recommend INSTIs as first-line agents. The role of TDM in INSTIs shifts to cases of insufficient viral suppression with standard adherence measures, cases of drug-drug interactions, or cases where EVG/c is continued throughout pregnancy, and thus remains an important aspect of HIV care in pregnancy.'),\n",

DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a previously developed HIV transmission model to analyse the epidemiological impact of PrEP provision to adolescents, young adults, pregnant women, female sex workers (FSWs) and (MSM), and data from South African PrEP programmes to estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP (cost in 2019 USD per HIV infection averted over 20 years, 2019, 38). PrEP uptake followed data from early implementation sites, scaled-up linearly over 3 years, with target coverage set to 18% for adolescents, young adults and pregnant women, 30% for FSW and 54% for MSM. RESULTS: The annual cost of PrEP provision ranges between $75 and $134 per person. PrEP provision adolescents and young adults, regardless of risk behaviour, will each avert 3.2--4.8% of HIV infections over 20 years; provision to high-risk individuals only has similar impact at lower total cost. The incremental cost per HIV infection averted is lower in high-risk vs. all-risk sub-populations within female adolescents ($507 vs. $4537), male adolescents ($2108 vs. $5637), young women ($1592 vs. $10 323) and young men ($2605 vs. $7715), becoming cost saving within 20 years for high-risk adolescents, young women, MSM and FSWs. CONCLUSION: PrEP is an expensive prevention intervention but uptake by those at the highest risk of HIV infection will make it more cost-effective, and cost-saving after 14-18 years.'),\n",

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 544 African Americans [369 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 175 HIV seronegative] from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort. Cocaine use was determined with a validated self-reported questionnaire and confirmed with urine screen.

Results: Men living with HIV had 1.79 times higher odds for liver fibrosis than women living with HIV (p = 0.038). African American women had higher CD4 count (p = 0.001) and lower HIV viral load (p = 0.011) compared to African American men. Fewer women (PLWH and HIV seronegative) smoked cigarettes (p = 0.002), and fewer had hazardous or harmful alcohol use (p < 0.001) than men. Women also had higher body mass index (kg/m(2)) (p < 0.001) compared to men. No significant association was noted among HIV seronegative participants for liver fibrosis by sex differences or cocaine use. Among African Americans living with HIV, cocaine users were 1.68 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than cocaine nonusers (p = 0.044).

METHODOLOGY: Data were collected at two levels: first, interviews were conducted with informants to identify venues where FSWs and MSM frequent. Secondly, the size of MSM and FSWs were estimated through interviews with FSWs, MSM and other informants at the venue. The venue estimates were aggregated to generate the ward level estimates. Correction factors were then applied to adjust for MSM/FSW counted twice or more, absent from the venues on the mapping day or remain online and hidden. The ward size estimates for mapped wards were extrapolated to non-mapped wards and aggregated to generate district and regional level estimates. RESULTS: A total of 4,557 level I interviews were conducted. Further, 3,098 FSWs and 1,074 other informants at the FSWs venues and 558 MSM and 210 other informants at the MSM venues were interviewed during level II. The mapping survey identified 6,658 FSW, 1,099 FSW and MSM and 50 MSM venues in 75 wards. A total of 118,057 (range: 108,269 to 127,845) FSWs and 23,771 (range: 22,087 to 25,454) MSM were estimated in the study regions after extrapolation and accounting for correction factors.

Participants were divided into compliant (>/=1 exercise session/week) and non-compliant (<1 exercise session/week) groups according to their attendance in the intervention. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the change in BDI from baseline to post-intervention was assessed with an analysis of covariance, adjusted for demographics. The post-intervention BDI score was significantly lower (p = 0.027) for the compliant group compared to the non-compliant group, and the rate of improvement from moderate/severe symptoms of depression to minimal symptoms of depression was four times greater in the compliant group.

HIV co-infected persons are particularly vulnerable to the serious and potentially fatal consequences of untreated helminth infection. While general screening guidelines exist for parasitic infection screening in immigrant populations, they remain silent on HIV positive populations. This study assessed the seroprevalence, epidemiology and laboratory characteristics of these two parasitic infections in a non-endemic setting in an immigrant/refugee HIV positive community. METHODS: Between February 2015 and 2018 individuals born outside of Canada receiving care at the centralized HIV clinic serving southern Alberta, Canada were screened by serology and direct stool analysis for schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis. Canadian born persons with travel-based exposure risk factors were also screened. Epidemiologic and laboratory values were analyzed using bivariate logistic regression. We assessed the screening utility of serology, direct stool analysis, eosinophilia and hematuria. RESULTS: 253 HIV positive participants were screened. The prevalence of positive serology for Schistosoma and Strongyloides was 19.9 and 4.4%, respectively. Age between 40 and 50 years (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.13-5.50), refugee status (3.55, 1.72-7.33), country of origin within Africa (6.15, 2.44-18.60), eosinophilia (3.56, 1.25-10.16) and CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) (2.46, 1.02-5.92) were associated with positive Schistosoma serology. Eosinophilia (11.31, 2.03-58.94) was associated with positive Strongyloides serology. No Schistosoma or Strongyloides parasites were identified by direct stool microscopy. Eosinophilia had poor sensitivity for identification of positive serology. Hematuria was not associated with positive Schistosoma serology. CONCLUSION: Positive Schistosoma and Strongyloides serology was common in this migrant HIV positive population receiving HIV care in Southern Alberta. This supports the value of routine parasitic screening as part of standard HIV care in non-endemic areas. Given the high morbidity and mortality in this relatively immunosuppressed population, especially for Strongyloides infection, screening should include both serologic and direct parasitological tests. Eosinophilia and hematuria should not be used for Schistosoma and Strongyloides serologic screening in HIV positive migrants in non-endemic settings.'),\n",

The proportion of defective proviruses increases during cART, but the dynamics of this process are not well understood, and a quantitative analysis of how the proviral landscape is reshaped after cART is initiated is critical to understanding how HIV persists. Here, we studied longitudinal samples from HIV infected individuals undergoing long term cART using multiplexed Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) approaches to quantify the proportion of deleted proviruses in lymphocytes. In most individuals undergoing cART, HIV proviruses that contain gag are lost more quickly than those that lack gag. Increases in the fraction of gag-deleted proviruses occurred only after 1-2 years of therapy, suggesting that the immune system, and/or toxicity of viral re-activation helps to gradually shape the proviral landscape. After 10-15 years on therapy, there were as many as 3.5-5 times more proviruses in which gag was deleted or highly defective than those containing intact gag. We developed a provirus-specific ddPCR approach to quantify individual clones. Investigation of a clone of cells containing a deleted HIV provirus integrated in the HORMAD2 gene revealed that the cells underwent a massive expansion shortly after cART was initiated until the clone, which was primarily in effector memory cells, dominated the population of proviruses for over 6 years. The expansion of this HIV-infected clone had substantial effects on the overall proviral population.'),\n",

We surveyed HIV clinics throughout Kenya to determine AYA clinic practices, disclosure and transition services. METHODS: We deployed a mobile team to conduct surveys in a random sample of 102 public HIV clinics with> 300 total clients. Data were collected from healthcare workers offering AYA services who had >6 months of experience delivering AYA care. RESULTS: Of 102 surveyed HIV clinics, almost all (101/102) had the same staff to provide services to all age groups. AYA-specific services included dedicated clinic days (91%), the majority being on weekends (57%) and designated clinic spaces (20%). Activities to support AYA retention and adherence were common (support groups [97%] and HIV literacy meetings [93%]). Fewer clinics offered more holistic care, including psychosocial support (16%) and career education (2%), posted additional staff during the AYA day (17%), provided food (17%) or had sporting activities (10%) as incentives. Tracking of disclosure of HIV status to AYA was common (87%). In 40% of clinics, disclosure discussions with caregivers or AYA occurred a median of 2 years later in practice than stated in clinic policy. Transition was not routinely tracked, and definitions were heterogeneous. Median age at transition was reported as 20 years (range: 14-30 years). CONCLUSION: HIV programmes have implemented varied approaches to enhance AYA services that could be leveraged to support transition to adult services. Research on the impact of these services on health outcomes is needed.'),\n",

       "  'Polypharmacy is a well-described problem in the geriatric population. It is a relatively new problem for people living with HIV (PLWH), as this group now has a life expectancy approaching that of the general population. Defining polypharmacy for PLWH is difficult, since the most common traditional definition of at least five medications would encompass a large percentage of PLWH who are on antiretrovirals (ARVs) and medications for other medical comorbidities. Even when excluding ARVs, the prevalence of polypharmacy in PLWH is higher than the general population, and not just in resource-rich countries. Using a more nuanced approach with \"appropriate\" or \"safer\" polypharmacy allows for a better framework for discussing how to mitigate the associated risks. Some of the consequences of polypharmacy include adverse effects of medications including the risk of geriatric syndromes, drug-drug interactions, decreased adherence, and over- and undertreatment of medical comorbidities. Interventions to combat polypharmacy include decreasing pill burden-specifically with fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets- and medication reconciliation/deprescription using established criteria. The goal of these interventions is to decrease drug interactions and improve quality of life and outcomes. Some special populations of interest within the community of PLWH include those with chronic pain, substance abuse, or requiring end of life care. A final look into the future of antiretroviral therapy (ART) shows the promise of possible two-drug regimens, which can help reduce the above risks of polypharmacy.'),\n",

Because infancy is a time of rapid progression from primary infection to active TB disease, it is important to define when and how TB preventive interventions exert their effect in order to develop effective prevention strategies in this high-risk population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a non-blinded randomised controlled trial to determine efficacy of isoniazid (INH) to prevent primary Mtb infection among HEU children. Target sample size is 300 (150 infants in each arm). Children are enrolled at 6 weeks of age from maternal and child health clinics in Kenya and are randomised to receive 12 months of daily INH ~10 mg/kg plus pyridoxine or no INH. The primary endpoint is Mtb infection, assessed by interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) or tuberculin skin test after 12 months post-enrolment. Secondary outcomes include severe adverse events, expanded Mtb infection definition using additional QFT-Plus supernatant markers and determining correlates of Mtb infection. Exploratory analyses include a combined outcome of TB infection, disease and mortality, and sensitivity analyses excluding infants with baseline TB-specific responses on flow cytometry. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: An external and independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board monitors adverse events. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, presentations at local and international conferences to national and global policy-makers, the local community and participants.

During HIV-1 infection, human dendritic cells (DCs) can detect the virus through an innate sensing pathway, leading to antiviral interferon and DC maturation. Here, we develop an iterative experimental and computational approach to map the HIV-1 innate response circuitry in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). By integrating genome-wide chromatin accessibility with expression kinetics, we infer a gene regulatory network that links 542 transcription factors with 21,862 target genes. We observe that an interferon response is required, yet insufficient, to drive MDDC maturation and identify PRDM1 and RARA as essential regulators of the interferon response and MDDC maturation, respectively.

However, the proportion of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA) missing school, studying with difficulties and dropping out of school in Uganda has been observed to be higher than that of other youth. This study aimed at understanding the barriers and facilitators for YLWHA in Uganda to attend school. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative inquiry with 35 purposively selected YLWHA aged 12 to 19 years, including 16 females at three accredited Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment centres in Kabarole district in Western Uganda. Individual semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic inductive analysis. RESULTS: We identified five main themes in which barriers to attend school were reported and four main themes in which facilitators were reported by participants. The main themes for barriers were: 1) management of ART and illnesses, 2) fear, negative thoughts and self-devaluation, 3) lack of meaningful and supportive relationships, 4) reactionary attitudes and behaviours from others at school, 5) financial challenges. The main themes for facilitators were: 1) practical support at school, home and community, 2) counselling, encouragement and spirituality, 3) individual coping strategies, 4) hopes, dreams and opportunities for the future. CONCLUSION: Most of the barriers reported arose from HIV-related stigma and financial challenges whose genesis transcends school boundaries. While YLWHA reported measures to cope, and support from other people, these were non-sustainable and on a limited scale due to disclosure apprehension at school and the indiscretion of those who learnt about their status. To promote supportive school environments for YLWHA, integrated curricular and extracurricular interventions are necessary to increase HIV knowledge, dispel misconceptions about HIV and consequently transform the school community from a stigmatizing one to a supportive one.'),\n",

Data were analyzed using a modified framework analysis approach. Results: Participants had a mean age of 54 years and were predominantly male (70%) and non-Hispanic black (65%). Most described periods of being able to adhere to ARVs while still using drugs, difficulty adhering to ARVs while using drugs, and abstinence/near abstinence from drug use. In exploring factors that influenced changes in drug use and ARV adherence behaviors, we noted consistent acknowledgment of the roles of family, partners, or providers.

The pharmacist evaluated patients for medical contraindications to PrEP, but no baseline labs were obtained. The pharmacist provided a PrEP prescription and scheduled a clinical appointment for patients within 6 weeks, at which time they were evaluated by a clinician and completed baseline labs.

Determining the regions within SERINC5 that provide restrictive activity or Nef sensitivity should inform mechanistic models of the SERINC5/HIV-1 relationship. Here, we report that deletion of the conserved sequence EDTEE, which is located within a cytoplasmic loop of SERINC5 and which is reminiscent of an acidic-cluster membrane trafficking signal, increases the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by Nef, while it has no effect on the intrinsic activity of the protein as an inhibitor of infectivity. These effects correlated with enhanced removal of the DeltaEDTEE mutant relative to that of wild-type SERINC5 from the cell surface and with enhanced exclusion of the mutant protein from virions by Nef. Mutational analysis indicated that the acidic residues, but not the threonine, within the EDTEE motif are important for the relative resistance to Nef. Deletion of the EDTEE sequence did not increase the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by the glycoGag protein of MLV, suggesting that its virologic role is Nef specific. These results are consistent with the reported mapping of the cytoplasmic loop that contains the EDTEE sequence as a general determinant of Nef responsiveness, but they further indicate that sequences inhibitory to as well as supportive of Nef activity reside in this region. We speculate that the EDTEE motif might have evolved to mediate resistance against retroviruses that use Nef-like proteins to antagonize SERINC5.IMPORTANCE Cellular membrane proteins in the SERINC family, especially SERINC5, inhibit the infectivity of retroviral virions. This inhibition is counteracted by retroviral proteins, specifically, HIV-1 Nef, MLV glycoGag, and EIAV S2. One consequence of such a host-pathogen \"arms race\" is a compensatory change in the host antiviral protein as it evolves to escape the effects of viral antagonists. This is often reflected in a genetic signature, positive selection, which is conspicuously missing in SERINC5 Here we show that despite this lack of genetic evidence, a sequence in SERINC5 nonetheless provides relative resistance to antagonism by HIV-1 Nef.'),\n",

Effective biomedical prevention methods (treatment as prevention and preexposure prophylaxis) are being widely implemented in high-income nations. Therefore, research into quality of life, including sexual adjustment, is of increasing importance to HIV care. Yet, sexual adjustment of PLWH has been neglected in past research. We propose a new model of sexual adjustment to HIV which explores the dynamic process, facilitators and barriers characterising sexual life of PLWH overtime. METHOD: Thirty PLWH (19 male, 11 female) recruited from two HIV treatment centres as well as community groups, completed semi-structured interviews which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis using grounded theory. RESULTS: The model of sexual adjustment to HIV is the first to establish how undue fears of transmission of HIV during sex and/or fear of rejection by sexual partners determine initial sexual behaviour after diagnosis and also sexual adjustment over time. Within the model, sexual adjustment to HIV is facilitated by factors which assist PLWH to overcome such fears, including: partner acceptance, peer, community and health professional support, and accurate knowledge of risk of transmission including of undetectable viral load and pre-exposure prophylaxis. Adjustment is inhibited when undue fears of transmission and of rejection persist long term, resulting in maladaptive behaviours to cope with such fears including avoidance of sex and problematic drug and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: This model offers clear directions for promoting sexual adjustment to HIV. Health professionals should: (a) assess and intervene for sexual quality of life (not just risk) among PLWH; (b) be aware that serosorting facilitates adjustment in the short to medium term, but may interfere with adjustment long-term, (c) promote opportunities for positive connection between PLWH, and (d) intervene directly with PLWH and HIV negative sexual partners to promote accurate risk of transmission knowledge, including how this applies to their own sexual practices, and whether they are experiencing undue fear of transmission over time.'),\n",

Fifty-five patients discontinued EFV within the study period. About 55.7% of patients suffered from at least one neuropsychiatric AE, the most commonly recorded symptoms were depression, vivid dreams, dizziness, and sleep disturbance. There was an inverse relationship between number of AE and EFV continuation [adjust odds ratio (OR) = 0.12; confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.03-0.44, p < .05].

Index samples were obtained up to 5.5 years before partner infection; partner samples were obtained near the time of seroconversion. The bioinformatics method, phyloscanner, was used to infer transmission direction. Analyses were performed using samples from individual sample pairs, samples from all couples (1 sample/person; group analysis), and all available samples (multisample group analysis). Analysis was also performed using NGS data from defined regions of the HIV genome (gag, pol, env).

Potent clinical inhibitors of HIV-1 protease show several orders of magnitude worse inhibition of highly drug-resistant variants. Hence, the structure and enzyme activities were analyzed for HIV protease mutant HIV-1 protease (EC 3.4.23.16) (PR) with 22 mutations (PRS5B) from a clinical isolate that was selected by machine learning to represent high-level drug-resistance. PRS5B has 22 mutations including only one (I84V) in the inhibitor binding site; however, clinical inhibitors had poor inhibition of PRS5B activity with kinetic inhibition value (Ki ) values of 4-1000 nm or 18- to 8000-fold worse than for wild-type PR. High-resolution crystal structures of PRS5B complexes with the best inhibitors, amprenavir (APV) and darunavir (DRV) (Ki ~ 4 nm), revealed only minor changes in protease-inhibitor interactions. Instead, two distinct clusters of mutations in distal regions induce coordinated conformational changes that decrease favorable internal interactions across the entire protein subunit. The largest structural rearrangements are described and compared to other characterized resistant mutants. In the protease hinge region, the N83D mutation eliminates a hydrogen bond connecting the hinge and core of the protease and increases disorder compared to highly resistant mutants PR with 17 mutations and PR with 20 mutations with similar hinge mutations. In a distal beta-sheet, mutations G73T and A71V coordinate with accessory mutations to bring about shifts that propagate throughout the subunit. Molecular dynamics simulations of ligand-free dimers show differences consistent with loss of interactions in mutant compared to wild-type PR.

We described the prevalence of co-occurring hashtags and explored thematic concepts in the images using automated image recognition and topic modeling. Twenty-eight percent of all #HIV posts included hashtags focused on awareness, followed by LGBTQ (24.5%) and living with HIV (17.9%).

The study of resilience within the context of HIV-related stigma among MSM living with HIV represents a promising area of research to inform the development of future HIV interventions for this population. We examined resilience within the context of HIV related stigma among MSM living with HIV in Louisiana with a particular interest in how resilience may be more relevant for Black MSM. We utilized Pearson's correlations and layered chi-square non-parametric tests to examine associations and racial differences in resilience, four HIV-related stigma measures/consequences (i.e., anticipated, internalized, enacted, and consequences of enacted HIV stigma), and HIV care outcomes (i.e., length of time since last HIV care visit, time since last HIV lab result, most recent HIV viral load result) among 110 MSM living with HIV in Louisiana who participated in the Louisiana HIV Stigma Index Project. The majority of MSM participants were Black (75%), lived in New Orleans (52%), and reported limited education (52%) and income (76%). MSM who reported higher levels of enacted HIV stigma, consequences of enacted HIV stigma, and internalized HIV stigma reported poorer HIV care outcomes. Both internalized and anticipated HIV stigma significantly negatively impacted Black MSM perceptions of their overall health compared with White MSM. Compared with White MSM, Black MSM who reported greater consequences of enacted HIV stigma had poorer HIV care outcomes. Resilience was associated with positive HIV care outcomes for both Black and White MSM. However, having higher levels of resilience may have been more protective for Black MSM such that higher levels of resilience were associated with less time since last HIV care visit for Black MSM than for White MSM. The current study provides preliminary information on the potential positive relationship between resilience and HIV care outcomes among MSM, particularly Black MSM. However, these findings need to be confirmed among a more representative sample of Black and White MSM in Louisiana.\"),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Young people account for more than a quarter of new HIV infections in the US, with the majority of cases among young men who have sex with men; young transgender women are also vulnerable to infection. Substance use, particularly alcohol misuse, is a driver of sexual transmission and a potential barrier to engagement in the HIV prevention and care continuum, however vulnerable youth are difficult to reach for substance use services due, in part, to complex social and structural factors and limited access to health care. The Community Prevention Services Task Force recommends electronic screening and brief intervention as an evidence-based intervention for the prevention of excessive alcohol consumption; however, no prior studies have extended this model to community-based populations of youth that are susceptible to HIV infection. This paper describes the study protocol for an electronic screening and brief intervention to reduce alcohol misuse among adolescents and young adults vulnerable to HIV infection in community-based settings. METHODS: This study, Step Up, Test Up, is a randomized controlled trial of an electronic alcohol screening and brief intervention among youth, ages 16-25, who are vulnerable to HIV infection. Individuals who present for HIV testing at one of three community-based locations are recruited for study participation. Eligibility includes those aged 16-25 years, HIV-negative or unknown HIV status, male or trans female with a history of sex with men, and English-speaking. Participants who screen at moderate to high risk for alcohol misuse on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) are randomized (1:1) to either an electronic brief intervention to reduce alcohol misuse or a time-and attention-matched control. The primary outcome is change in the frequency/quantity of recent alcohol use at 1, 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Testing of evidence-based interventions to reduce alcohol misuse among youth vulnerable to HIV infection are needed. This study will provide evidence to determine feasibility and efficacy of a brief electronically-delivered intervention to reduce alcohol misuse for this population.

We developed 2 PrEP cascades for Australia's primary HIV-affected population, gay and bisexual men. METHODS: Data were drawn from 2 national, repeated, cross-sectional surveys (the Gay Community Periodic Surveys and PrEPARE Project). One cascade had 3 steps, and the other had 7 steps. Trends over time were assessed using logistic regression. For the most recent year, we identified the biggest drop between steps in each cascade and compared the characteristics of men between the 2 steps using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Thirty-nine thousand six hundred and seventy non-HIV-positive men participated in the Periodic Surveys during 2014-2018. PrEP eligibility increased from 28.1% (1901/6762) in 2014 to 37.3% (2935/7878) in 2018 (P < 0.001), awareness increased from 29.6% (563/1901) to 87.1% (2555/2935; P < 0.001), and PrEP use increased from 3.7% (21/563) to 45.2% (1155/2555; P < 0.001). Of 1038 non-HIV-positive men in the PrEPARE Project in 2017, 54.2% (n = 563) were eligible for PrEP, 97.2% (547/563) were aware, 67.6% (370/547) were willing to use PrEP, 73.5% (272/370) had discussed PrEP with a doctor, 78.3% (213/272) were using PrEP, 97.2% (207/213) had recently tested, and 75.8% (157/207) reported reduced HIV concern and increased pleasure because of PrEP. The break point analyses indicated that PrEP coverage was affected by geographical availability, education level, employment, and willingness to use PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP eligibility, awareness, and use have rapidly increased among Australian gay and bisexual men. The cascades identify disparities in uptake by eligible men as a result of socioeconomic factors and PrEP's acceptability.\"),\n",

To address this issue, we examined the distribution of genetically intact HIV DNA within HLA-DR- and HLA-DR+ memory CD4 T cells and the RNA transcriptional profile of these cells during antiretroviral therapy. DESIGN/METHODS: Full-length DNA sequencing was used to examine the HIV DNA landscape within HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR- memory CD4 T cells. RNA quantification and sequencing was used to interrogate the relationship between HLA-DR status and HIV RNA transcription. RESULTS: HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells contained a high frequency of genetically intact HIV genomes, contributing over half of the genetically intact viral sequences to the reservoir. Expansions of genetically identical sequences were identified in all T-cell subsets, indicating that cellular proliferation maintains genetically intact and defective viral DNA during therapy. Intracellular HIV RNA levels in HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR- T cells were not statistically different by either long terminal repeat quantitative PCR quantification or single-genome RNA sequencing of the p6-RT region. CONCLUSION: The high proportion of intact viral DNA sequences in the proliferative HLA-DR+ subset suggests they are critical in maintaining HIV infection during effective therapy. As such, these cells should be included in any immune intervention targeting HIV during effective therapy.'),\n",

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of women who were transfused during pregnancy (>48 hr before anticipated delivery) at two hospitals in Durban and Soweto in 2014 to 2015. Medical record data on demographics, obstetric history, anemia, HIV status, and indications for blood transfusion were abstracted. RESULTS: The records on a total of 560 transfused pregnant women were evaluated; mean age was 28 years, 98% were of black African ethnicity, and 28% were HIV positive. At time of transfusion, one-half were in the first trimester. Hemorrhage was noted in 76% of women, most of which was associated with abortion (67%) or ectopic pregnancy (27%). Most women were transfused with red blood cells (RBCs; median, 2 units); 14% of women were transfused with plasma and 2% with platelets. Median pre- and posttransfusion hemoglobin levels were 6.9 g/dL and 9.2 g/dL, respectively; the latter differed by hospital (8.7 g/dL vs. 9.5 g/dL; p < 0.01). Hemorrhage was associated with missing HIV status, lower gestational age, and transfusion of 3 or more RBC units (all p < 0.01). In contrast, diagnoses of anemia (Soweto only) were associated with HIV infection, later gestational age, and lower (<3 units) RBC dose (all p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Abortion and ectopic pregnancy with associated hemorrhage were the leading indications for antenatal transfusion and were concentrated in early gestation. By contrast, anemia was associated with HIV infection and transfusion in the third trimester.'),\n",

       "  \"BACKGROUND: An individual is considered HIV positive when a confirmatory HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test returns positive following an initial reactive antigen/antibody combination screen. Falsely reactive HIV screens have been reported in patients with various concomitant infectious and autoimmune conditions. Falsely positive confirmatory HIV differentiation assays are seen less frequently, but have been observed in cases of pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, and malaria. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 27 year-old man was referred after a reactive ADVIA Centaur(R) HIV Ag/Ab screen and positive Bio-Rad Geenius HIV 1/2 Confirmatory assay, suggesting HIV-1 infection. The patient's HIV viral load was undetectable prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and remained undetectable on subsequent testing after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Both Centaur(R) and Geenius tests were repeated and returned reactive. As this patient was believed to be at low risk of acquiring HIV infection, samples were additionally run on Genscreen HIV-1 Ag assay and Fujirebio Inno-LIA HIV-1/2 score, with both returning non-reactive. For confirmation, the patient's proviral HIV DNA testing was negative, confirming the initial results as being falsely positive. The patient disclosed that he had been using a variety of anabolic steroids before and during the time of HIV testing. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The erroneous diagnosis of HIV can result in decreased quality of life and adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy if initiated, hence the importance of interpreting the results of HIV testing in the context of an individual patient. This reports suggests a potential association between the use of anabolic steroids and falsely-reactive HIV testing.\"),\n",

METHODS: In a 30-minute cognitive assessment, CI was defined as -1SD on 2 tests or -2SD on one, as compared with 429 controls. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic and linear models examining clinical and demographic factors associated with CI and global neuropsychological performance (NP-6). RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred seventy-two HIV+ participants from Kenya (n = 1503), Tanzania (n = 469), and Uganda (n = 500). The mean (SD) age was 39.7 (10.7) years, and 1452 (59%) were women.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. METHODS: We investigated the effect of cART use and other clinical and demographic factors on spontaneous PTB (sPTB) rates (<37 weeks gestational age) among 631 singleton pregnancies between 1997 and 2018. Exposure to cART was modelled in comparison to no exposure, exposure in the first trimester, and between regimens. Differences in sPTB risk were estimated using time-dependent Cox's proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall, the sPTB rate was 16%. Cumulative cART use was associated with lower risk of PTB (Wald test P = 0.02; hazard ratio = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99) and specific cART regimens were not associated with increased risk of sPTB. Exposure in the first trimester was not associated with sPTB and for each week of cART exposure, the risk of sPTB decreased by 2%. In a multivariable model, HIV viral load and substance use remained associated with risk of sPTB, but not cART exposure. CONCLUSION: The sPTB rate among pregnant WLWH was more than three times higher than in the general population. However, sPTB was not related specifically to use of cART; in fact, cART appeared to reduce the risk of sPTB. Uncontrolled HIV replication and substance use were associated with increased risk of sPTB among pregnant WLWH. This emphasizes the important role of prenatal care, access to cART, and smoking cessation and harm reduction to reduce the risk of sPTB in WLWH.\"),\n",

Botswana, a middle-income country in SSA, has the second highest prevalence of HIV worldwide and has seen an increase in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer over the last decade in the setting of improved survival of HIV-infected women. There is an urgent need to understand more clearly the causes and consequences of HPV-associated cervical cancer in the setting of HIV infection. We initiated the Ipabalele ('take care of yourself' in Setswana) programme to address this need for new knowledge and to initiate long-term research programme capacity building in the region. In this manuscript, we describe the components of the programme, including three main research projects as well as a number of essential cores to support the activities of the programme. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Our multidisciplinary approach aims to further current understanding of the problem by implementing three complementary studies aimed at identifying its molecular, behavioural and clinical determinants. Three participant cohorts were designed to represent the early, intermediate and late stages of the natural history of cervical cancer.The functional structure of the programme is coordinated through programmatic cores. These allow for integration of each of the studies within the cohorts while providing support for pilot studies led by local junior investigators. Each project of the Ipabalele programme includes a built-in capacity building component, promoting the establishment of long-lasting infrastructure for future research activities. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Institutional review board approvals were granted by the University of Pennsylvania, University of Botswana and Ministry of Health and wellness of Botswana. Results will be disseminated via the participating institutions and with the help of the Community Advisory Committee, the project's Botswana advisory group.\")]"
