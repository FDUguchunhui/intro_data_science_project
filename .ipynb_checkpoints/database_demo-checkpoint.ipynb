       "  'Since the emergence of HIV and AIDS in the early 1980s, the development of safe and effective therapies has accompanied a massive increase in our understanding of the fundamental processes that drive HIV biology. As basic HIV research has informed the development of novel therapies, HIV inhibitors have been used as probes for investigating basic mechanisms of HIV-1 replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. This positive feedback cycle has led to the development of highly effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which has helped stall the progression to AIDS, prolong lives, and reduce transmission of the virus. However, to combat the growing rates of virologic failure and toxicity associated with long-term therapy, it is important to diversify our repertoire of HIV-1 treatments by identifying compounds that block additional steps not targeted by current drugs. Most of the available therapeutics disrupt early events in the replication cycle, with the exception of the protease (PR) inhibitors, which act at the virus maturation step. HIV-1 maturation consists of a series of biochemical changes that facilitate the conversion of an immature, noninfectious particle to a mature infectious virion. These changes include proteolytic processing of the Gag polyprotein by the viral protease (PR), structural rearrangement of the capsid (CA) protein, and assembly of individual CA monomers into hexamers and pentamers that ultimately form the capsid. Here, we review the development and therapeutic potential of maturation inhibitors (MIs), an experimental class of anti-HIV-1 compounds with mechanisms of action distinct from those of the PR inhibitors. We emphasize the key insights into HIV-1 biology and structure that the study of MIs has provided. We will focus on three distinct groups of inhibitors that block HIV-1 maturation: (1) compounds that block the processing of the CA-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) cleavage intermediate, the original class of compounds to which the term MI was applied; (2) CA-binding inhibitors that disrupt capsid condensation; and (3) allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) that block the packaging of the viral RNA genome into the condensing capsid during maturation. Although these three classes of compounds have distinct structures and mechanisms of action, they share the ability to block the formation of the condensed conical capsid, thereby blocking particle infectivity.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Many countries encourage same-day initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but evidence on eligibility for same-day initiation, how best to implement it, and its impact on outcomes remains scarce. Building on the Simplified Algorithm for Treatment Eligibility (SLATE) I trial, in which nearly half of participants were ineligible for same-day initiation mainly because of TB symptoms, the study evaluated the revised SLATE II algorithm, which allowed same-day initiation for patients with mild TB symptoms and other less serious reasons for delay. METHODS AND FINDINGS: SLATE II was a nonblinded, 1:1 individually randomized pragmatic trial at three primary healthcare clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa. It randomized adult patients presenting for an HIV test or any HIV care but not yet on ART. Intervention arm patients were assessed with a symptom screen, medical history, brief physical examination, and readiness questionnaire to distinguish between patients eligible for immediate ART dispensing and those requiring further care before initiation. Standard arm patients received usual care. Follow-up was by review of routine clinic records. Primary outcomes were (1) ART initiation in </=7 days and (2) ART initiation in </=28 days and retention in care at 8 months (composite outcome). From 14 March to 18 September 2018, 593 adult HIV+, nonpregnant patients were enrolled (median interquartile range [IQR] age 35 [29-43]; 63% (n = 373) female; median CD4 count 293 [133-487]). Half of study patients (n = 295) presented with TB symptoms, whereas only 13 (4%) standard arm and 7 (2%) intervention arm patients tested positive for TB disease. Among 140 intervention arm patients with TB symptoms, 72% were eligible for same-day initiation. Initiation was higher in the intervention (n = 296) versus standard arm (n = 297) by 7 days (91% versus 68%; risk difference [RD] 23% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17%-29%]) and 28 days (94% versus 82%; RD 12% [7%-17%]) after enrollment. In total, 87% of intervention and 38% of standard arm patients initiated on the same day. By 8 months after study enrollment, 74% (220/296) of intervention and 59% (175/297) of standard arm patients had both initiated ART in </=28 days and been retained in care (RD 15% [7%-23%]). Among the 41% of participants with viral load results available, suppression was 90% in the standard arm and 92% in the intervention arm among patients initiated in </=28 days. No ART-associated adverse events were reported after initiation; two intervention and four standard arm patients were reported to have died during passive follow-up. Limitations of the study included limited geographic generalizability, exclusion of patients too sick to consent, fluctuations in procedures in the standard arm over the course of the study, high fidelity to the trial protocol by study staff, and the possibility of overestimating loss to follow-up due to data constraints. CONCLUSIONS: More than 85% of patients presenting for HIV testing or care, including those newly diagnosed, were eligible and ready for same-day initiation under the SLATE II algorithm. The algorithm increased initiation within 7 days without appearing to compromise retention and viral suppression at 8 months, offering a practical and acceptable approach that can be widely and immediately utilized by existing providers.

We introduced multidisciplinary staff to the concept of using a palliative approach early (ePA) in outpatient HIV care management to enable them to consider the patient-level complexity of these young men. Young MSM (18-35 years of age) enrolled in and cared for at the intervention site of the Care and Support Access Study (CASA), completed serial surveys over 18 months. Patients' Global and Summary quality of life (QoL) increased during the study at the intervention site (IS) where staff learned about ePA, compared with patients attending the control site (CS) (p=.021 and p=.018, respectively). Using serial surveys of staff members, we found that in the era of HIV disease control, outpatient staff are stressed more by environmental factors than by patients' disease status seen historically in the HIV epidemic.

       "  'INTRODUCTION: People who inject drugs (PWID) in Ukraine have high prevalences of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Since the turn of the century, various organizations have funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine to provide PWID with needles and syringes, condoms, HIV and HCV testing, and improve linkage to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and HIV treatment. We investigated whether contact with these NGOs was associated with improved HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among PWID. METHODS: Five rounds of respondent-driven sampled integrated bio-behavioural survey data (2009 [N = 3962], 2011 [N = 9069], 2013 [N = 9502], 2015 [N = 9405], and 2017 [N = 10076]) among PWID in Ukraine (including HIV/HCV testing and questionnaires) were analysed using mixed-effect logistic regression models (mixed-effects: city, year). These regression models assessed associations between being an NGO client and various behavioural, OAT, HIV testing and HIV treatment outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics (age, gender, lifetime imprisonment, registration in a drug abuse clinic, education level). We also assessed associations between being an NGO client and being HIV positive or HCV positive, likewise adjusting for demographic characteristics (as above). RESULTS: NGO clients were more likely to have received HIV testing ever (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 4.97 to 5.80) or in the last year (aOR 3.37, 95% CI: 3.20 to 3.54), to have used condoms at last sexual intercourse (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.44) and sterile needles at last injection (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.56), to be currently (aOR 4.19, 95% CI: 3.48 to 5.05) or ever (aOR 2.52, 95% CI: 2.32 to 2.74) on OAT, and to have received syringes (aOR 109.89, 95% CI: 99.26 to 121.66) or condoms (aOR 54.39, 95% CI: 50.17 to 58.96) in the last year. PWID who were HIV positive (aOR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.33 to 1.48) or HCV positive (aOR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.65) were more likely to have contact with NGOs, with HIV positive PWID in contact with NGOs being more likely to be registered at AIDS centres (aOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.88 to 2.92) and to be on antiretroviral therapy (aOR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Contact with PWID targeted NGOs in Ukraine is associated with consistently better preventive, HIV testing and HIV treatment outcomes, suggesting a beneficial impact of harm reduction NGO programming.'),\n",

       "  \"Sustained, drug-free control of HIV-1 replication is naturally achieved in less than 0.5% of infected individuals (here termed 'elite controllers'), despite the presence of a replication-competent viral reservoir(1). Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Kruppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation(2,3), may be feasible in rare instances.\"),\n",

Methods: We collected urine and whole blood from antiretroviral-therapy-naive patients with HIV and a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts < 200 cells/mm(3) for plasma and urine CrAg lateral flow assay (LFA) screening at the national HIV reference laboratory. Two CD4 cut-off points were used to estimate CrAg prevalence: CD4 < 100 and < 200 cells/mm(3). Sensitivity and specificity of urine CrAg LFA was compared to plasma CrAg LFA. Results: Plasma CrAg prevalence was 4% (8/182, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2-8) amongst patients with CD4 counts of < 200 cells/mm(3), and 8% (8/102, 95% CI: 3-15) amongst patients with CD4 counts of < 100 cells/mm(3).

These immunotherapies include immune checkpoint inhibitors and advances in cellular immunotherapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Despite the field of cancer immunotherapy rapidly expanding with ongoing clinical trials, people with HIV are often excluded from such trials. In 2019, post-approval evaluation of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in people with HIV and aggressive B-cell lymphoma showed the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy for cancer in this excluded group. Along with expanded treatment options for people with HIV is the ability to assess the effects of immunotherapy on the latent HIV reservoir, with certain immunotherapies showing the ability to alleviate this burden. This Series paper addresses the increased cancer burden in people with HIV, the increasing evidence for the safety and efficacy of immunotherapies in the context of HIV and cancer, and opportunities for novel applications of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of both haematological malignancies and HIV.'),\n",

METHODS: In a prospective cohort study in Bangwe primary care clinic, Blantyre, Malawi, all adults (18 years or older) presenting with an acute illness were screened for TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). Demographic characteristics were linked to exit interview by fingerprint bioidentification. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the proportion completing same-visit HIV testing, comparing between those with and without TB symptoms. RESULTS: There were 5427 adult attendees between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Exit interviews were performed for 2402 (44%). 276 patients were excluded from the analysis, being already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Presentation with any TB symptom was common for men (54.6%) and women (57.4%). Overall 27.6% (585/ 2121) attenders reported being offered testing and 21.5% (455/2121) completed provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) and received results. The proportions offered testing were similar among participants with and without TB symptoms (any TB symptom: 29.0% vs. 25.7%). This was consistent for each individual symptom; cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Multivariable regression models indicated men, younger adults and participants who had previously tested were more likely to complete PITC than women, older adults and those who had never previously tested. CONCLUSIONS: Same-visit completion of HIV testing was suboptimal, especially among groups known to have high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV.

However, no latency reversal agent (LRA) to date effectively clears viral reservoirs in humans, suggesting a need for new LRAs and LRA combinations.

Neither agent\\'s activity depends on protein kinase C; nor do they inhibit class I/II histone deacetylases. However, they are differentially modulated by oxidative stress and metal ions and induce distinct patterns of global gene expression from established LRAs. When applied in combination, both KA and anthralin synergize with LRAs representing multiple functional classes. Finally, KA induces both HIV RNA and protein in primary cells from HIV-infected donors. Taken together, we describe two novel LRAs that enhance the activities of multiple \"shock-and-kill\" agents, which in turn may inform ongoing LRA combination therapy efforts.'),\n",

We characterized HIVDR among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and experienced participants in the African Cohort Study (AFRICOS). METHODS: From January 2013 to April 2019, adults with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/mL underwent ART history review and HIVDR testing upon enrollment at 12 clinics in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria. We calculated resistance scores for specific drugs and tallied major mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) using Stanford HIVDB 8.8 and SmartGene IDNS software. For ART-naive participants, World Health Organization surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were noted. RESULTS: HIVDR testing was performed on 972 participants with median age 35.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 29.7-42.7) years and median CD4 295 (IQR 148-478) cells/mm3. Among 801 ART-naive participants, the prevalence of SDRMs was 11.0%, NNRTI mutations 8.2%, NRTI mutations 4.7%, and PI mutations 0.4%. Among 171 viremic ART-experienced participants, NNRTI mutation prevalence was 83.6%, NRTI 67.8%, and PI 1.8%. There were 90 ART-experienced participants with resistance to both efavirenz and lamivudine, 33 (36.7%) of whom were still prescribed these drugs. There were 10 with resistance to both tenofovir and lamivudine, 8 (80.0%) of whom were prescribed these drugs.

DESIGN: This HIV stigma study was nested in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, a three-arm cluster randomised trial conducted between 2013 and 2018 in 21 urban/peri-urban communities (12 in Zambia and nine in South Africa). METHODS: Using an adjusted two-stage cluster-level analysis, controlling for baseline imbalances, we compared multiple domains of stigma between the trial arms at 36 months. Different domains of stigma were measured among three cohorts recruited across all study communities: 4178 randomly sampled adults aged 18-44 who were living with HIV, and 3487 randomly sampled adults and 1224 health workers who did not self-report living with HIV. RESULTS: Prevalence of any stigma reported by people living with HIV at 36 months was 20.2% in arm A, 26.1% in arm B, and 19.1% in arm C (adjusted prevalence ratio, A vs. C 1.01 95% CI 0.49-2.08, B vs. C 1.34 95% CI 0.65-2.75).

Despite the reduction in AIDS-related deaths achieved by current antiretroviral therapies, drawbacks including drug resistance and the failure to eradicate infection highlight the need to identify new pathways to target the infection. Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-h oscillations which regulate physiological processes including immune responses to infection, and there is an emerging role for the circadian components in regulating viral replication. The molecular clock consists of transcriptional/translational feedback loops that generate rhythms. In mammals, BMAL1 and CLOCK activate rhythmic transcription of genes including the nuclear receptor REV-ERBalpha, which represses BMAL1 and plays an essential role in sustaining a functional clock. We investigated whether REV-ERB activity regulates HIV-1 replication and found REV-ERB agonists inhibited HIV-1 promoter activity in cell lines, primary human CD4 T cells and macrophages, whilst antagonism or genetic disruption of REV-ERB increased promoter activity. The REV-ERB agonist SR9009 inhibited promoter activity of diverse HIV-subtypes and HIV-1 replication in primary T cells. This study shows a role for REV-ERB synthetic agonists to inhibit HIV-1 LTR promoter activity and viral replication, supporting a role for circadian clock components in regulating HIV-1 replication.'),\n",

Young adults with recent HIV acquisition frequently seek care for symptoms and could potentially be diagnosed through the health care system. Early recognition of HIV infection provides considerable individual and public health benefits, including linkage to treatment as prevention, access to risk reduction counseling and treatment, and notification of partners in need of HIV testing. OBJECTIVE: The Tambua Mapema Plus study aims to (1) test 1500 young adults (aged 18-39 years) identified by an AHI screening algorithm for acute and prevalent (ie, seropositive) HIV, linking all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients to care and offering immediate treatment; (2) offer assisted HIV partner notification services to all patients with HIV, testing partners for acute and prevalent HIV infection and identifying local sexual networks; and (3) model the potential impact of these two interventions on the Kenyan HIV epidemic, estimating incremental costs per HIV infection averted, death averted, and disability-adjusted life year averted using data on study outcomes. METHODS: A modified stepped-wedge design is evaluating the yield of this HIV testing intervention at 4 public and 2 private health facilities in coastal Kenya before and after intervention delivery. The intervention uses point-of-care HIV-1 RNA testing combined with standard rapid antibody tests to diagnose AHI and prevalent HIV among young adults presenting for care, employs HIV partner notification services to identify linked acute and prevalent infections, and follows all newly diagnosed patients and their partners for 12 months to ascertain clinical outcomes, including linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients, and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake in uninfected individuals in discordant partnerships. RESULTS: Enrollment started in December 2017. As of April 2020, 1374 participants have been enrolled in the observation period and 1500 participants have been enrolled in the intervention period, with 13 new diagnoses (0.95%) in the observation period and 37 new diagnoses (2.47%), including 2 AHI diagnoses, in the intervention period. Analysis is ongoing and will include adjusted comparisons of the odds of the following outcomes in the observation and intervention periods: being tested for HIV infection, newly diagnosed with prevalent or acute HIV infection, linked to care, and starting ART by week 6 following HIV diagnosis. Participants newly diagnosed with acute or prevalent HIV infection in the intervention period are being followed for outcomes, including viral suppression by month 6 and month 12 following ART initiation and partner testing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The Tambua Mapema Plus study will provide foundational data on the potential of this novel combination HIV prevention intervention to reduce ongoing HIV transmission in Kenya and other high-prevalence African settings.

HIV stigma is a risk factor that can undermine adherence. We explored the association between HIV stigma and self-reported ART adherence among PLHIV in 21 communities in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial in Zambia and the Western Cape of South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected between 2013 and 2015, before the roll-out of trial interventions. Questionnaires were conducted, and consenting participants provided a blood sample for HIV testing. Poor adherence was defined as self-report of not currently taking ART, missing pills over the previous 7 days or stopping treatment in the previous 12 months. Stigma was categorised into three domains: community, health setting and internalised stigma. Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS: Among 2020 PLHIV self-reporting ever taking ART, 1888 (93%) were included in multivariable analysis. Poor ART adherence was reported by 15.8% (n = 320) of participants, and 25.7% (n = 519) reported experiencing community stigma, 21.5% (n = 434) internalised stigma, and 5.7% (n = 152) health setting stigma.

These measures may decrease people\\'s sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of gay and bisexual men in Australia. METHODS: Between April 4, 2020, and April 29, 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19 and whether they engaged in sexual behavior with regular or casual partners or \"fuckbuddies\" in the 6 months before becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as \"before COVID-19\"), and following the date, they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as \"since COVID-19\"). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants\\' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the 6 months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION: Gay and bisexual men in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioral changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recent (within 4 months) HIV-1 infections were identified using a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm of new HIV-1 diagnoses in the UK. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase were detected by ultradeep sequencing, which allows for the sensitive estimation of the frequency of each resistant variant in a sample. RESULTS: The analysis included 655 randomly selected individuals (median age = 33 years, 95% male, 83% MSM, 78% white) sampled in the period 2014 to 2016 and determined to have a recent infection. These comprised 320, 138 and 197 samples from 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. None of the samples had major InSTI RAMs occurring at high variant frequency (>/=20%). A subset (25/640, 3.9%) had major InSTI RAMs occurring only as low-frequency variants (2%-20%). In contrast, 47/588 (8.0%) had major reverse transcriptase inhibitor and PI RAMs at high frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2014 and 2016, major InSTI RAMs were uncommon in adults with recent HIV-1 infection, only occurring as low-frequency variants of doubtful clinical significance. Continued surveillance of newly diagnosed patients for evidence of transmitted InSTI resistance is recommended to inform clinical practice.'),\n",

Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) may have accelerated atherosclerosis and shorter TL than the general population. It is unknown whether TL is associated with CAD in PLWH. METHODS: We measured TL by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in white Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants. Cases had a first CAD event during 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2017. We matched 1-3 PLWH controls without CAD events on sex, age, and observation time. We obtained univariable and multivariable odds ratios (OR) for CAD from conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We included 333 cases (median age 54 years; 14% women; 83% with suppressed HIV RNA) and 745 controls. Median time (interquartile range) of TL measurement was 9.4 (5.9-13.8) years prior to CAD event. Compared to the 1st (shortest) TL quintile, participants in the 5th (longest) TL quintile had univariable and multivariable CAD event OR = 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], .35-.91) and OR = 0.54 (95% CI, .31-.96). Multivariable OR for current smoking was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.27-2.92), dyslipidemia OR = 1.92 (95% CI, 1.41-2.63), and for recent abacavir, cumulative lopinavir, indinavir, and darunavir exposure was OR = 1.82 (95% CI, 1.27-2.59), OR = 2.02 (95% CI, 1.34-3.04), OR = 3.42 (95% CI, 2.14-5.45), and OR = 1.66 (95% CI, 1.00-2.74), respectively. The TL-CAD association remained significant when adjusting only for Framingham risk score, when excluding TL outliers, and when adjusting for CMV-seropositivity, HCV-seropositivity, time spent with detectable HIV viremia, and injection drug use. CONCLUSIONS: In PLWH, TL measured >9 years before, is independently associated with CAD events after adjusting for multiple traditional and HIV-related factors.'),\n",

A key function of Nef is to remove the CD4 receptor from the cell surface by hijacking clathrin- and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis. However, exactly how Nef does this has been elusive. Here, we describe the underlying mechanism as revealed by a 3.0-A crystal structure of a fusion protein comprising Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 bound to the tetrameric AP2 complex. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. A pocket on Nef previously identified as crucial for recruiting class I MHC is also responsible for recruiting CD4, revealing a potential approach to inhibit two of Nef's activities and sensitize the virus to immune clearance.\"),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) around the world are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. National policy responses to the epidemic heavily influence risk factors for HIV acquisition among this key group. Prior efforts to monitor national policy responses to HIV/AIDS among PWID were limited both in scope and coverage. In this paper we develop and validate the HIV-PWID Policy Index (HPPI) to benchmark and monitor national commitments to HIV prevention and treatment among PWID. METHODS: Composite indicator was constructed employing fuzzy multilayer data envelopment analysis (FMLDEA). Model inputs based on data from 105 countries included 27 variables measured across six conceptual domains, including needle and syringe programs, opioid substitution treatment, testing and counseling, information and education, monitoring and evaluation, and legal and policy climate. RESULTS: According to the HPPI, which ranges from 0 to 1, the top performing countries in policy commitments to HIV prevention and treatment among PWID were Spain (0.988), Switzerland (0.982), Luxembourg (0.970), Moldova (0.970), and Kyrgyzstan (0.945), whereas the poorest performing included Nicaragua (0.094), Japan, (0.094), Cape Verde (0.097), Syria (0.174), and Benin (0.185). Regionally, commitment to HIV services targeting PWID was highest among European countries (0.81) and lowest among African countries (0.50), with Oceania (0.76), Asia (0.66), and the Americas (0.56) in the mid-range. Subregional differences were even more prominent, with West and Central European nations (0.84) and Central American nations (0.22) earning the highest and lowest HPPI scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The HPPI documented substantial national and regional variation in policy responses to the HIV epidemic among PWID. Our analysis also revealed that many countries have limited HIV/AIDS data collection and monitoring capabilities. Continued enhancement and standardization of global HIV/AIDS monitoring efforts are therefore vital to articulated national and international benchmarking and performance assessment goals.'),\n",

After a positive VIA in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, data on demographics, CD4 count, and use of antiretroviral therapy and a cervical swab were collected. HPV typing was performed using the Roche Linear Array. RESULTS: Of 175 participants, 86 (49.1%) were HIV-positive and had a higher prevalence of low-risk HPV types (odds ratio [OR] 5.28, P=0.005) compared with HIV-negative women. The most common high-risk (HR)-HPV types in HIV-positive women were HPV 16 (13.9%) and HPV 18 (11.1%). HIV-positive women requiring LEEP were more likely to have HR-HPV types (OR 6.67, P=0.012) and to be infected with multiple HR-HPV types (OR 7.79, P=0.024) compared to those undergoing cryotherapy.

Here, we report primary results from a blinded phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide versus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention. METHODS: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics located in regions of Europe and North America, where there is a high incidence of HIV or prevalence of people living with HIV, or both. We enrolled adult cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, both with a high risk of acquiring HIV on the basis of their self-reported sexual behaviour in the past 12 weeks or their recent history (within 24 weeks of enrolment) of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Participants with current or previous use of PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were not excluded. We used a computer-generated random allocation sequence to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive either emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). As such, all participants were given two tablets. The trial sponsor, investigators, participants, and the study staff who provided the study drugs, assessed the outcomes, and collected the data were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was incident HIV infection, which was assessed when all participants had completed 48 weeks of follow-up and half of all participants had completed 96 weeks of follow-up. This full analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug and had at least one post-baseline HIV test. Non-inferiority of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was established if the upper bound of the 95.003% CI of the HIV incidence rate ratio (IRR) was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.62. We prespecified six secondary bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints to evaluate using the safety analysis set. This analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02842086, and is no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 5387 (92%) of 5857 participants were randomly assigned and received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (n=2694) or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=2693). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis (ie, when all participants had completed 48 weeks and 50% had completed 96 weeks) emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, as the upper limit of the 95% CI of the IRR, was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.62 (IRR 0.47 [95% CI 0.19-1.15]). After 8756 person-years of follow-up, 22 participants were diagnosed with HIV, seven participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group (0.16 infections per 100 person-years [95% CI 0.06-0.33]), and 15 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (0.34 infections per 100 person-years [0.19-0.56]). Both regimens were well tolerated, with a low number of participants reporting adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study drug (36 [1%] of 2694 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group vs 49 [2%] of 2693 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was superior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all six prespecified bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints. INTERPRETATION: Daily emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide shows non-inferior efficacy to daily emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, and the number of adverse events for both regimens was low. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide had more favourable effects on bone mineral density and biomarkers of renal safety than emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

We described the HIV cascade among young females who sell sex (YFSS) (N = 408) versus those young females who do not sell sex (YFNS) (N = 891) and triangulated the potential (100% test acceptance and accuracy) and feasible (accounting for test acceptance and sensitivity) number of AGYW that could be newly diagnosed through hotspot-based HIV rapid testing in Mombasa. We identified the profile of AGYW with an HIV in the past year using generalized linear mixed regression models. RESULTS: N = 37/365 (10.1%) YFSS and N = 30/828 (3.6%) YFNS were living with HIV, of whom 27.0% (N = 10/37) and 30.0% (N = 9/30) were diagnosed and aware (P = 0.79).

ART targets replicating virally infected but not latently infected cells, which have limited expression of factors important for proliferation and cellular activity, including positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Levels of the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of P-TEFb are low to absent in resting T cells, and treatment with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) increases CycT1 protein levels to those of proliferating T cells. In this study, the clinically approved PI bortezomib reactivated latent HIV in latently infected primary CD4+ T cells. Bortezomib not only increased levels of CycT1 but also activated NF-kappaB. Strikingly, as opposed to most currently researched latency reversing agents (LRAs), bortezomib did not require a second LRA to potently reactivate latent HIV. Effects of bortezomib on resting T cells and reactivation of HIV suggest a possible direction for future attempts to diminish the viral reservoir in HIV+ individuals.'),\n",

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3.0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

A spatiotemporal, residential cluster was identified in a 9-square-mile area within six adjacent communities. The majority of persons affected were MSM, and this area was visited by many other persons with mumps diagnoses. Spatiotemporal analyses could be used in real time to identify case clusters to target public health response efforts, including to guide recommendations for additional measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and to identify specific transmission venues.'),\n",

Specific data on the impact in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected patients are lacking. In this study, all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks stratified per era of diagnosis are investigated. Methods: Data were analyzed from HIV/HBV-coinfected patients enrolled in the ATHENA cohort between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2017. Risk for (cause-specific) mortality was calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, comparing patients diagnosed before 2003 with those diagnosed >/=2003. Risk factors for all-cause and liver-related mortality were also assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: A total of 1301 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients were included (14 882 person-years of follow-up). One-hundred ninety-eight patients (15%) died during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed in or after 2003 was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35-0.72) relative to patients diagnosed before 2003. Similar risk reduction was observed for liver-related (aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.75) and AIDS-related mortality (aHR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.87). Use of a tenofovir-containing regimen was independently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and liver-related mortality. Prior exposure to didanosine/stavudine was strongly associated with liver-related mortality. Ten percent of the population used only lamivudine as treatment for HBV. Conclusions: All-cause, liver-related, and AIDS-related mortality risk in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients has markedly decreased over the years, coinciding with the introduction of tenofovir. Tenofovir-containing regimens, in absence of major contraindications, should be strongly encouraged in this population.'),\n",

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells within secondary lymphoid tissues exist in a low-oxygen or hypoxic environment in vivo. However, the majority of studies on HIV replication and latency are performed under laboratory conditions where HIFs are inactive. We show a role for HIF-2alpha in restricting HIV transcription via direct binding to the viral promoter. Hypoxia reduced tumor necrosis factor or histone deacetylase inhibitor, Romidepsin, mediated reactivation of HIV and inhibiting HIF signaling-pathways reversed this phenotype. Our data support a model where the low-oxygen environment of the lymph node may suppress HIV replication and promote latency. We identify a mechanism that may contribute to the limited efficacy of latency reversing agents in reactivating HIV and suggest new strategies to control latent HIV-1.'),\n",

We conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of BFCI in changing knowledge and attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and increasing the rates among HIV negative and HIV positive women in rural Kenya. METHODS: A community-based cluster-randomized controlled trial was implemented from April 2015 to December 2016 among 901 women enrolled across 13 clusters. The intervention groups received a minimum of 12 personalized home-based counselling sessions on infant feeding by trained community health volunteers from their first or second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Other interventions included education sessions at maternal child clinics, mother-to-mother support group meetings and bi-monthly baby-friendly gatherings targeting influencers. The control group received standard health education at the facility and during monthly routine home visits by community health volunteers not trained on BFCI. Primary outcome measures were the rates of EBF at week 1, months 2, 4 and 6 postpartum. Secondary outcomes included knowledge and attitudes regarding breastfeeding for HIV-exposed infants. Statistical methods included analysis of covariance and logistic regression. RESULTS: At 6 months, EBF rates among HIV negative mothers were significantly higher in the BFCI intervention arm compared to the control arm (81.7% versus 42.2% p = 0.001). HIV positive mothers in the intervention arm had higher EBF rates at 6 months than the control but the difference was not statistically significant (81.8% versus 58.4%; p = 0.504). In HIV negative group, there was greater knowledge regarding EBF for HIV-exposed infants in the intervention arm than in the control (92.1% versus 60.7% p = 0.001). Among HIV positive mothers, such knowledge was high among both the intervention and control groups (96% versus 100%, p > 0.1). HIV negative and positive mothers in the intervention arm had more favourable attitudes regarding EBF for HIV-exposed infants than the control (84.5% versus 62.1%, p = 0.001) and (94.6% versus 53.8% to p = 0.001) respectively.

HIV-infected children are at a higher risk of TB infection and disease compared to those without HIV. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is an effective intervention in preventing progression of latent TB infection to active TB. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that all children aged > 12 months and adults living with HIV in whom active TB has been excluded should receive a 6-months course of IPT as part of a comprehensive package of HIV care. Despite this recommendation, the uptake of IPT among PLHIV has been suboptimal globally. This study sought to determine the factors affecting IPT uptake and completion among HIV-infected children in a large HIV care centre in Nairobi, Kenya. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional mixed methods study comprising of quantitative and qualitative study designs. Medical records of 225 HIV-infected children aged 1 to < 10 years, in care in the Kenyatta National Hospital Comprehensive Care Centre (KNH CCC) were retrospectively reviewed, and 8 purposively selected healthcare providers and 18 consecutively selected caregivers of children were interviewed. RESULTS: IPT uptake among CLHIV in care in the KNH CCC was 68% (152/225) while the treatment completion rate was 82% (94/115). IPT-related health education and counselling were the main facilitators of IPT uptake and completion, while fear of adverse drug reaction, pill burden and lack of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system for IPT were the major barriers. CONCLUSION: The IPT uptake in this study was low and fell short of the set global target of > 90%. The completion rate was however acceptable. There is an urgent need to address the identified barriers.'),\n",

Due to its potency, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a viable candidate for LA PrEP. However, the inherent hydrolytic instability of TAF presents a challenge for application in LA systems. In this work, we examined the mechanism of TAF hydrolysis in a reservoir-based implant system and characterized TAF degradation kinetics as a function of the solution pH. We determined a pH \"stability window\" between pH 4.8 - 5.8 in which TAF degradation is substantially mitigated, with minimal degradation at pH 5.3. In a pursuit of a TAF formulation suitable for LA PrEP, we studied trans-urocanic acid (UA) as a buffer excipient. Here we show that UA can maintain the pH of TAF free base (TAFfb) solution inside a surrogate implant model at approximately pH 5.4. Through in vitro analysis, we demonstrated preservation of released TAF purity above 90% for over 9 months. Further, we performed an in vivo assessment of TAFfb-UA formulation in a reservoir-based nanofluidic implant inserted subcutaneously in non-human primates. Preventive levels of tenofovir diphosphate above 100 fmol/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells were achieved in 2 days and sustained over 35 days. Fluid retrieved from implants after 60 days of implantation showed that UA preserved the aqueous phase in the implant at ~ pH 5.5, effectively counteracting the neutralizing action of interstitial fluids. Moreover, residual TAF in the implants maintained > 98% purity. Overall, TAF-UA represents a viable formulation applicable for LA HIV PrEP.'),\n",

The study primary objective is to investigate factors associated with faster initial HIV RNA half-life decay when combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) is initiated in pregnancy. METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study, conducted in south England, United Kingdom, between August 2001 and February 2018. Data were extracted from case notes of eligible women initiating cART during the index pregnancy. Anonymised data were collated and analysed centrally. Regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with faster HIV RNA half-life decay in the first 14 days after commencing cART (first-phase), and with achieving an undetectable maternal pVL by 36 weeks' gestation. We then assessed whether HIV- and obstetric- related parameters differed by antiretroviral third agent class and whether the proportions of women with undetectable pVL at 36 weeks' gestation and at delivery differed by antiretroviral third agent class. RESULTS: Baseline pVL was the only independent factor associated with faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Lower pVL on day 14 after starting cART was associated with an increased likelihood of achieving an undetectable pVL by 36 weeks' gestation. Integrase inhibitor-based cART was associated with a faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Overall, 73% and 85% of women had an undetectable pVL at 36 weeks' gestation and at delivery respectively, with no significant difference by antiretroviral third agent class. CONCLUSIONS: Only high baseline pVL independently contributed to a faster rate of first-phase viral half-life decay. pVL at 14 days after initiating cART allows early identification of treatment failure. In the first 14 days after initiating cART in pregnancy, integrase inhibitor-based cART reduced maternal pVL faster than protease inhibitor- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase-based cART. While our study findings support INSTI use when initiated in pregnancy especially when initiated at later gestations and in those with higher baseline pVL, other non-INSTI based cART with more data on safety in pregnancy also performed well.\"),\n",

Obtaining accurate COD is valuable for mortality prevention priorities. The statements are formulated using International Classification of Diseases and related health problems, version 10 (ICD-10) system. However, physicians may be unfamiliar with these standards or fail to use them and instead refer to mechanisms or manner of death when stating COD. We present results of an of assessment of quality of COD statements in decedent cases reviewed during a one-month mortuary-based surveillance at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and the City mortuaries in Nairobi, Kenya in 2015. METHODS: Quality elements reviewed were completeness, correctness and order of stating the immediate (ICOD), antecedent, underlying (UCOD), and other significant causes (OSCs) as per the ICD 10 standards, in all deaths reported among adolescents and adults aged 15 years or older at the two mortuaries. COD were assessed for correct sequencing from immediate, antecedent, to underlying compared with autopsy pathology and clinical findings where available. Errors in COD statements were classified as missing or containing incomplete information such as: lack of underlying cause of an injury; incorrect words or statements; presence of more than one competing COD; use of the mechanism of death or anatomic and physiologic processes or signs and symptoms, and or laboratory results as CODs. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare proportions. RESULTS: Out of 810, 610 (75.3%) deaths having HIV statuses were abstracted and 356 had at least one COD documented; 114 (32%) females and 242 (68%) males; 239 (67.1%) from KNH and 117 (32.9%) City mortuary. The cases from City mortuary had higher rates of correct statements on 116 (99.1%) ICOD, 90 (89.1%) UCOD, and 40 (81.6%) OSCs, compared to KNH Mortuary; 50 (20.9%), 200 (90.1%) and 62 (76.5%) respectively, p < 0.001. The most common type of errors was incomplete information and citing mechanisms of death as the COD. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to revising national forms to conform to ICD-10, there is a need for periodic training of individuals responsible for completing death certificates.

Cessation of anti-retroviral treatment after three years results in viral rebound in most, but about one in seven individuals contains the virus, so-called post-treatment controllers. We suggest an understanding, of how the Th1/Th2 phenotype of immune responses is controlled, can explain these different outcomes and leads us to propose a non-invasive, personalized strategy of immunotherapy.

Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the risk of female-to-male transmission of HIV by 50-60%. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) identified 14 priority countries for VMMC campaigns and set a coverage goal of 80% for men ages 15-49. From 2008 to 2017, over 18 million VMMCs were reported in priority countries. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about local variation in male circumcision (MC) prevalence. METHODS: We analyzed geo-located MC prevalence data from 109 household surveys using a Bayesian geostatistical modeling framework to estimate adult MC prevalence and the number of circumcised and uncircumcised men aged 15-49 in 38 countries in sub-Saharan Africa at a 5 x 5-km resolution and among first administrative level (typically provinces or states) and second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. RESULTS: We found striking within-country and between-country variation in MC prevalence; most (12 of 14) priority countries had more than a twofold difference between their first administrative level units with the highest and lowest estimated prevalence in 2017. Although estimated national MC prevalence increased in all priority countries with the onset of VMMC campaigns, seven priority countries contained both subnational areas where estimated MC prevalence increased and areas where estimated MC prevalence decreased after the initiation of VMMC campaigns. In 2017, only three priority countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania) were likely to have reached the MC coverage target of 80% at the national level, and no priority country was likely to have reached this goal in all subnational areas. CONCLUSIONS: Despite MC prevalence increases in all priority countries since the onset of VMMC campaigns in 2008, MC prevalence remains below the 80% coverage target in most subnational areas and is highly variable. These mapped results provide an actionable tool for understanding local needs and informing VMMC interventions for maximum impact in the continued effort towards ending the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.'),\n",

In contrast, results from the few CAR T-cell studies for infectious diseases such as HIV-1 have been less convincing. These challenges are likely due to the low level of antigen present in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed patients in contrast to those with hematologic malignancies. Using our well-established nonhuman primate model of ART-suppressed HIV-1 infection, we tested strategies to overcome these limitations and challenges. We first optimized CAR T-cell production to maintain central memory subsets, consistent with current clinical paradigms. We hypothesized that additional exogenous antigen might be required in an ART-suppressed setting to aid expansion and persistence of CAR T cells. Thus, we studied 4 simian/HIV-infected, ART-suppressed rhesus macaques infused with virus-specific CD4CAR T cells, followed by supplemental infusion of cell-associated HIV-1 envelope (Env). Env boosting led to significant and unprecedented expansion of virus-specific CAR+ T cells in vivo; after ART treatment interruption, viral rebound was significantly delayed compared with controls (P = .014). In 2 animals with declining CAR T cells, rhesusized anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody was administered to reverse PD-1-dependent immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade triggered expansion of exhausted CAR T cells and concordantly lowered viral loads to undetectable levels. These results show that supplemental cell-associated antigen enables robust expansion of CAR T cells in an antigen-sparse environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show expansion of virus-specific CAR T cells in infected, suppressed hosts, and delay/control of viral recrudescence.'),\n",

       "  'Oral antiretroviral agents provide life-saving treatments for millions of people living with HIV, and can prevent new infections via pre-exposure prophylaxis(1-5). However, some people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced have limited or no treatment options, owing to multidrug resistance(6). In addition, suboptimal adherence to oral daily regimens can negatively affect the outcome of treatment-which contributes to virologic failure, resistance generation and viral transmission-as well as of pre-exposure prophylaxis, leading to new infections(1,2,4,7-9). Long-acting agents from new antiretroviral classes can provide much-needed treatment options for people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced, and additionally can improve adherence(10). Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV.'),\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Current models of HIV service delivery, with frequent facility visits, have led to facility congestion, patient and healthcare provider dissatisfaction, and suboptimal quality of services and retention in care. The Zambian urban adherence club (AC) is a health service innovation designed to improve on-time drug pickup and retention in HIV care through off-hours facility access and pharmacist-led group drug distribution. Similar models of differentiated service delivery (DSD) have shown promise in South Africa, but observational analyses of these models are prone to bias and confounding. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of ACs in Zambia using a more rigorous study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a matched-pair cluster randomized study design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02776254), 10 clinics were randomized to intervention (5 clinics) or control (5 clinics). At each clinic, between May 19 and October 27, 2016, a systematic random sample was assessed for eligibility (HIV+, age >/= 14 years, on ART >6 months, not acutely ill, CD4 count not <200 cells/mm3) and willingness to participate in an AC. Clinical and antiretroviral drug pickup data were obtained through the existing electronic medical record. AC meeting attendance data were collected at intervention facilities prospectively through October 28, 2017. The primary outcome was time to first late drug pickup (>7 days late). Intervention effect was estimated using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model to derive an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Medication possession ratio (MPR) and implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity) were additionally evaluated as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics were similar between 571 intervention and 489 control participants with respect to median age (42 versus 41 years), sex (62% versus 66% female), median time since ART initiation (4.8 versus 5.0 years), median CD4 count at study enrollment (506 versus 533 cells/mm3), and baseline retention (53% versus 55% with at least 1 late drug pickup in previous 12 months). The rate of late drug pickup was lower in intervention participants compared to control participants (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p < 0.001). Median MPR was 100% in intervention participants compared to 96% in control participants (p < 0.001). Although 18% (683/3,734) of AC group meeting visits were missed, on-time drug pickup (within 7 days) still occurred in 51% (350/683) of these missed visits through alternate means (use of buddy pickup or early return to the facility). Qualitative evaluation suggests that the intervention was acceptable to both patients and providers. While patients embraced the convenience and patient-centeredness of the model, preference for traditional adherence counseling and need for greater human resources influenced intervention appropriateness and feasibility from the provider perspective. The main limitations of this study were the small number of clusters, lack of viral load data, and relatively short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: ACs were found to be an effective model of service delivery for reducing late ART drug pickup among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. Drug pickup outside of group meetings was relatively common and underscores the need for DSD models to be flexible and patient-centered if they are to be effective.

Systematic reviews indicate stimulant injection is associated with HIV and HCV among PWID. Using these associations, we estimated the contribution of stimulant injection to HIV and HCV transmission among PWID. METHODS: We modeled HIV and HCV transmission among PWID, incorporating excess injecting and sexual risk among PWID who inject stimulants. We simulated three illustrative settings with different stimulants injected, prevalence of stimulant injecting, and HIV/HCV epidemiology. We estimated one-year population attributable fractions of stimulant injection on new HIV and HCV infections, and impact of scaling up needle-syringe programs (NSP). RESULTS: In low prevalence settings of stimulant injection (St. Petersburg-like, where 13 % inject amphetamine), 9% (2.5-97.5 % interval [95 %I]: 6-15 %) and 7% (95 %I 4-11 %) of incident HIV and HCV cases, respectively, could be associated with stimulant injection in the next year. With moderate stimulant injection (Montreal-like, where 34 % inject cocaine), 29 % (95 %I: 19-37 %) and 19 % (95 %I: 16-21 %) of incident HIV and HCV cases, respectively, could be associated with stimulant injection. In high-burden settings like Bangkok where 65 % inject methamphetamine, 23 % (95%I:10-34%) and 20 % (95%I: 9-27%) of incident HIV and HCV cases could be due to stimulant injection. High-coverage NSP (60 %) among PWID who inject stimulants could reduce HIV (by 22-65 %) and HCV incidence (by 7-11 %) in a decade. DISCUSSION: Stimulant injection contributes substantially to HIV and HCV among PWID. NSP scale-up and development of novel interventions among PWID who inject stimulants are warranted.'),\n",

These groups may not benefit from traditional HIV prevention interventions available at the health facilities where they live, but may benefit from services offered at public venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners (e.g. bars, nightclubs, transportation hubs and guest houses). The goal of this analysis was to estimate availability, access and uptake of prevention services by populations who visit these venues. METHODS: We collected cross-sectional data using the Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts sampling method at cross-border locations near or along the land and lake borders of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from June 2016-February 2017. This bio-behavioural survey captured information from a probability sample of 11,428 individuals at 833 venues across all areas. Data were weighted using survey sampling weights and analysed using methods to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: Among the 85.6% of persons who had access to condoms, 60.5% did not use a condom at their last anal or vaginal sexual encounter. Venues visited by high percentages of persons living with HIV were not more likely than other venues to offer condoms. In 12 of the 22 cross-border areas, male or female condoms were available at less than 33% of the venues visited by persons having difficulty accessing condoms. In 17 of the 22 cross-border areas, education outreach visits in the preceding six months occurred at less than 50% of the venues where participants had low effective use of condoms. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals visiting venues in cross-border areas report poor access to and low effective use of condoms and other prevention services. Availability of HIV prevention services differed by venue and population type and cross-border area, suggesting opportunities for more granular targeting of HIV prevention interventions and transnational coordination of HIV programming.'),\n",

Tomographic reconstructions document molecular features consistent with high-resolution structures of engineered soluble and detergent-solubilized Env trimers. One of three conformational states previously predicted by smFRET was not observed by cryo-ET, potentially owing to AT-2 inactivation. We did observe Env trimers to open in situ in response to CD4 binding, with an outward movement of gp120-variable loops and an extension of a critical gp41 helix.

DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of HEU infants in a prospective cohort study of mother-infant pairs. METHODS: Infants were recruited from immunization clinics (n = 151) in Zimbabwe from February to August 2013, enrolled at 4-12 weeks age, and followed every 3 months until incident HIV-infection, death, or 18-month follow-up. We estimated cumulative mortality probability and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, respectively. We also described reported reasons for infant hospitalization and symptoms preceding death. Median weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) and median age were calculated and analyzed across study visits. RESULTS: Of 1188 HIV-exposed infants, 73 (6.1%) contracted HIV; we analyzed the remaining 1115 HEU infants. In total, 54 (4.8%) infants died, with median time to death of 5.5 months since birth (interquartile range: 3.6-9.8 months). Diarrhea, difficulty breathing, not eating, fever, and cough were commonly reported (range: 7.4-22.2%) as symptoms preceding infant death. Low birth weight was associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.66, CI: 1.35-5.25), whereas maternal antiretroviral therapy predelivery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.34, CI: 0.18-0.64) and exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, CI: 0.28-0.91) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 9.6% of infants were hospitalized. Infant median WAZ declined after 3 months of age, reaching a minimum at 14.5 months of age, at which 50% of infants were underweight (WAZ below -2.0).

However, contemporary data on CVD among PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa in the current ART era are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the burden of cardiac stress among PLWH in South Africa via measurement of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). METHODS AND RESULTS: NT-proBNP was measured at baseline in 224 PLWH enrolled in a sub-study of a tuberculosis vaccine trial in Khayelitsha township near Cape Town, South Africa. Thresholds were applied at the assay's limit of detection (>/=137 pg/mL) and a level indicative of symptomatic heart failure in the acute setting (>300 pg/mL). Mean (SD) age of participants was 39 (6) years, 86% were female, and 19% were hypertensive. Mean (SD) duration of HIV diagnosis was 8.3 (3.9) years and CD4 + count was 673 (267) with 79% prescribed ART for a duration of 5.6 (2.7) years. Thirty-one percent of participants had NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL. Elevated vs. undetectable NT-proBNP level was associated with older age (P = 0.04), no ART (P = 0.03), and higher plasma tumour necrosis factor-alpha (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among South African PLWH largely free of known CVD and on ART with high CD4 + counts and few comorbidities, we observed a high proportion with elevated NT-proBNP levels, suggesting the burden of cardiac stress in this population may be high. This observation underscores the need for more in-depth research, including the current effect of HIV on heart failure risk among a growing ART-treated population in sub-Saharan Africa.\"),\n",

It affected 57% of South African patients whose antiretroviral therapy (ART) included stavudine and was influenced by genotypes of the P2X-block (P2X7R, P2X4R and CAMKK2). We investigate associations between HIV-SN and P2X-block genotypes in patients who never received stavudine. An adjacent gene, ANAPC5, was included. 75 HIV+ individuals were assessed using the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen before treatment and after 6-8 months on stavudine-free regimens. DNA was genotyped for 48 polymorphisms across the four genes using an OpenArray platform. Haplotypes were derived using fastPHASE. Associations with HIV-SN were assessed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Nine individuals (12%) were diagnosed with HIV-SN prior to ART and a further 20 individuals (27%) developed HIV-SN within 6-8 months. Five polymorphisms, rs503720*G (OR = 133) in P2X7R, rs10849861*A (OR = 5.99), rs1653586*T (OR = 67.8) and rs11065504*C (OR = 0.02) in CAMKK2, and rs2089886*A (OR = 6.68) in ANAPC5, associated with HIV-SN after adjusting for body weight, nadir CD4 T-cell counts and prior tuberculosis (model p < 0.0001, n = 69, Pseudo R(2) = 0.54). Three CAMKK2 haplotypes were associated with HIV-SN (OR = 2.82, 3.42 and 6.85) after adjusting for body weight, nadir CD4 T-cell counts and prior tuberculosis (model p < 0.0005, n = 71, Pseudo R(2) = 0.26). The results support a role for CAMKK2 in HIV-SN, independent of mechanisms invoked by stavudine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) remains a clinically relevant complication of HIV infection and its treatment, affecting 38% of patients treated without neurotoxic stavudine. HIV-SN can impact an individual's ability to work and quality of life, with few effective therapeutic options, so an understanding of the underlying mechanisms would have clinical value. We confirm that CAMKK2 polymorphisms and haplotypes influence susceptibility to HIV-SN in South Africans treated without stavudine. This provides further evidence for a role for the protein encoded by CAMKK2 in the pathogenesis of HIV-SN, independent of mechanisms initiated by stavudine.\"),\n",

We aim to study the cost-effectiveness of basic NCD-HIV integration in a Ugandan setting. METHODS: We developed an epidemiologic-cost model to analyze, from the provider perspective, the cost-effectiveness of integrating hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) and high cholesterol screening and treatment for people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. We utilized cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimations drawing from the previously established Globorisk model and systematic reviews; HIV and NCD risk factor prevalence from the World Health Organization's STEPwise approach to Surveillance survey and global databases; and cost data from national drug price lists, expert consultation and the literature. Averted CVD cases and corresponding disability-adjusted life years were estimated over 10 subsequent years along with incremental cost-effectiveness of the integration. RESULTS: Integrating services for hypertension, DM, and high cholesterol among ART patients in Uganda was associated with a mean decrease of the 10-year risk of a CVD event: from 8.2 to 6.6% in older PLWH women (absolute risk reduction of 1.6%), and from 10.7 to 9.5% in older PLWH men (absolute risk reduction of 1.2%), respectively. Integration would yield estimated net costs between $1,400 and $3,250 per disability-adjusted life year averted among older ART patients. CONCLUSIONS: Providing services for hypertension, DM and high cholesterol for Ugandan ART patients would reduce the overall CVD risk among these patients; it would amount to about 2.4% of national HIV/AIDS expenditure, and would present a cost-effectiveness comparable to other standalone interventions to address NCDs in low- and middle-income country settings.\"),\n",

However, there are few empirical population-representative estimates of viral suppression and the HIV care cascade including HIV testing among this population, nor of factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a respondent driven sampling (RDS) survey among 301 MSM/TG in Johannesburg in 2017. Participants gave blood samples for HIV testing and viral load. Participants self-completed a survey including sociodemographics, HIV testing history, and engagement in care. We calculated RDS-II weighted estimates of the percentage of HIV-negative MSM/TG reporting HIV testing in the previous 6 months, their testing experience and preferences. Among those HIV-positive, we estimated the percentage status-aware, on ART, and virally suppressed (<50 viral copies/ml plasma). We conducted RDS-weighted robust Poisson regression to obtain weighted prevalence ratios of factors associated with 1) HIV testing among those HIV-negative; and 2) viral suppression among those HIV-positive. RESULTS: There were 118/300 HIV-positive MSM/TG, (37.5%). Of the HIV-negative MSM/TG, 61.5% reported that they had tested for HIV in the previous 6 months, which was associated with selling sex to men (Prevalence Ratio = 1.67, 95% CI 1.36-2.05). There were 76/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG (56.5%) who reported having previously tested positive for HIV and 39/118 (30.0%) who reported current ART. There were 58/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG with viral loads <50 copies/ml plasma (46.9%). Viral suppression was associated with older age (adjusted PR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06 for each year), neighbourhood, and having bought sex from men (adjusted PR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.08). CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevalence was very high. Viral suppression among those HIV-positive was similar to the general male population in South Africa, but remains far short of national and international targets.

METHODS: We measured a panel of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-16, C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, interferon gamma-induced protein [IP]-10, soluble CD14, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type II [sTNFRII]) in CSF and blood plasma in PWH and HIV- individuals who did or did not use cannabis at various levels of exposure. Participants in this observational cohort were recruited from community sources and underwent lumbar puncture and phlebotomy. Cannabis use parameters were characterized by self-report based on a semistructured timeline follow-back interview. Cytokines were measured using commercially available immunoassays. Data were analyzed using factor analysis. RESULTS: Participants were 35 PWH and 21 HIV- individuals, mean (SD) age 45.4 (14.5) years, 41 cannabis ever users, and 15 never users. PWH and HIV- were not different in recency, cumulative months, grams, or density of cannabis use. A factor analysis using CSF biomarkers yielded a factor loading on CRP, IL-16, and sTNFRII that was significantly associated with recency of cannabis use (more recent use associated with lower factor 1 values, reflecting less inflammation; r = 0.331 [95% CI 0.0175, 0.586]). In particular, more recent cannabis use was related to lower IL-16 levels (r = 0.549 [0.282, 0.737]). Plasma biomarkers yielded a factor loading on sTNFRII and IP-10 that was associated with more recent cannabis use (more recent use related to less inflammation; r = 0.374 [0.0660, 0.617]). CONCLUSIONS: Recent cannabis use was associated with lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers, both in CSF and blood, but in different patterns. These results are consistent with compartmentalization of immune effects of cannabis. The principal active components of cannabis are highly lipid soluble and sequestered in brain tissue; thus, our findings are consistent with specific anti-neuroinflammatory effects that may benefit HIV neurologic dysfunction.'),\n",

       "  'HIV testing is the first step to early identification, treatment and management of HIV infection among people involved in high-risk behaviors specifically drug injection. Achieving declines in morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and reducing onward HIV transmission are key to testing and treatment. Evaluating the frequency of HIV testing among people who inject drugs (PWID) provides information that helps to identify missed opportunities to improve the efficacy of testing. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between HIV testing and risk taking behaviors among PWID. Two independent researchers reviewed the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane electronic databases, for manuscripts published between 2000 and 2017, to identify primary studies on the factors associated with HIV testing among PWID. After reviewing for duplication, the full texts of 16 articles were assessed for eligibility. We used fixed and random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled prevalence, pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the data collected. From the four databases 15,965 studies were identified. After evaluations of the citations, article title and abstracts 16 studies were included in the analysis. Findings indicate a significant association between HIV testing and having >/=6 years education (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.01-1.38), a history of imprisonment (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.30-2.53), access to needle syringe programs (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.00-2.21), and PWID attending a health professional or physician (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17-1.74). Appropriate strategies to increase awareness of primary care physicians on the importance of regular HIV testing will help with global targets for HIV elimination among PWID.'),\n",

The new guidelines recommended lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women irrespective of CD4 count or clinical stage (also referred to as Option B+). Uganda started implementing Option B+ in 2012 basing on the 2012 WHO guidelines. Despite the impressive benefits of the Option B+ strategy, implementation challenges, including cost burden and mother-baby pairs lost to follow-up, threatened its overall effectiveness. The researchers were unable to identify any studies conducted to assess costs and cost drivers associated with provision of Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs in HIV care in Uganda. Therefore, this study determined costs and cost drivers of providing Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs over a two-year period (2014-2015) in selected health facilities in Jinja district, Uganda. Methods: The estimated costs of providing Option B+ to mother-baby pairs derived from the provider perspective were evaluated at four health centres (HC) in Jinja district. A retrospective, ingredient-based costing approach was used to collect data for 2014 as base year using a standardized cost data capture tool. All costs were valued in United States dollars (USD) using the 2014 midyear exchange rate. Costs incurred in the second year (2015) were obtained by inflating the 2014 costs by the ratio of 2015 and 2014 USA Gross Domestic Product (GDP) implicit price deflator. Results: The average total cost of Option B+ services per HC was 66,512.7 (range: 32,168.2-102,831.1) USD over the 2-year period. The average unit cost of Option B+ services per mother-baby pair was USD 441.9 (range: 422.5-502.6). ART for mothers was the biggest driver of total mean costs (percent contribution: 62.6%; range: 56.0%-65.5%) followed by facility personnel (percent contribution: 8.2%; range: 7.7%-11.6%), and facility-level monitoring and quality improvement (percent contribution: 6.0%; range: 3.2%-12.3%). Conclusions and Recommendations. ART for mothers was the major cost driver. Efforts to lower the cost of ART for PMTCT would make delivery of Option B+ affordable and sustainable.'),\n",

       "  'The voltage-gated calcium channels CaV3.1-3.3 constitute the T-type subfamily, whose dysfunctions are associated with epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and chronic pain. The unique properties of low-voltage-activation, faster inactivation, and slower deactivation of these channels support their role in modulation of cellular excitability and low-threshold firing. Thus, selective T-type calcium channel antagonists are highly sought after. Here, we explored Ugi-azide multicomponent reaction products to identify compounds targeting T-type calcium channel. Of the 46 compounds tested, an analog of benzimidazolonepiperidine-5bk (1-{1-[(R)-{1-[(1S)-1-phenylethyl]-1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl}(thiophen-3-yl)methyl ]piperidin-4-yl}-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-one) modulated depolarization-induced calcium influx in rat sensory neurons. Modulation of T-type calcium channels by 5bk was further confirmed in whole-cell patch clamp assays in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, where pharmacological isolation of T-type currents led to a time- and concentration-dependent regulation with a low micromolar IC50. Lack of an acute effect of 5bk argues against a direct action on T-type channels. Genetic knockdown revealed CaV3.2 to be the isoform preferentially modulated by 5bk. High voltage-gated calcium, as well as tetrodotoxin-sensitive and -resistant sodium, channels were unaffected by 5bk. 5bk inhibited spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and depolarization-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from lumbar spinal cord slices. Notably, 5bk did not bind human mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. 5bk reversed mechanical allodynia in rat models of HIV-associated neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and spinal nerve ligation-induced neuropathy, without effects on locomotion or anxiety. Thus, 5bk represents a novel T-type modulator that could be used to develop nonaddictive pain therapeutics.'),\n",

Emerging point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic technologies for HIV viral load (VL) and early infant diagnosis (EID) may help reduce diagnostic gaps. However, these technologies need to be implemented in a complementary and strategic manner with laboratory-based instruments to ensure optimization. METHOD: Between May 2019 and February 2020, a systemic literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, conference abstracts, and other sources such as Unitaid, UNAIDS, WHO, and UNICEF websites to determine factors that would affect VL and EID scale-up. Data relevant to the search themes were reviewed for accuracy and were included. RESULTS: Collaborations among countries, implementing partners, and donors have identified a set of framework for the effective use of both POC-based and laboratory-based technologies in large-scale VL and EID testing programs. These frameworks include (1) updated testing policies on the operational utility of POC and laboratory-based technologies, (2) expanded integrated testing using multidisease diagnostic platforms, (3) laboratory network mapping, (4) use of more efficient procurement and supply chain approaches such as all-inclusive pricing and reagent rental, and (5) addressing systemic issues such as test turnaround time, sample referral, data management, and quality systems. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving and sustaining optimal VL and EID scale-up within tiered diagnostic networks would require better coordination among the ministries of health of countries, donors, implementing partners, diagnostic manufacturers, and strong national laboratory and clinical technical working groups.'),\n",

In an ongoing randomized clinical trial, 2 mobile communication strategies (ie, sending SMS text messages and real-time medication monitoring [RTMM]) were used to improve adherence to ART among people living with HIV in Tanzania. We noticed remarkable discrepancies between self-reported adherence and adherence recorded by SMS text messaging or RTMM among some of the first trial participants. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe these cases and the observed discrepancies in more detail, to serve as a useful illustration of some of the challenges in using mobile health in resource-limited settings. METHODS: In an ongoing randomized trial, adults living with HIV from two HIV treatment centers in Tanzania who were suspected of low levels of adherence were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive (1) SMS text message reminders, (2) an RTMM device, or (3) no additional intervention to standard HIV care. During bimonthly study visits, the participants self-reported their level of adherence, received feedback about their level of adherence based on SMS text messaging or RTMM, and discussed strategies to overcome adherence problems with nurses providing HIV care. For the purpose of this report, we selected people living with HIV who had completed 5 follow-up visits and consistently reported more than 95% adherence, while SMS text messaging or RTMM recorded lower than 75% adherence. The participants were invited for a short, face-to-face in-depth interview to explore reasons for this discrepancy. RESULTS: At the time of this analysis, 26 participants had completed follow-up. Six of these evidenced the above-mentioned discrepancies, with an average adherence of 46% based on SMS text messaging or RTMM, while self-reported adherence was 98%. Five of these 6 participants insisted that their adherence to ART was good, with 4 reporting that their adherence to properly using the monitoring device was low. Three participants mentioned concerns about involuntary disclosure of HIV status as a main reason for low adherence to using the device. Two participants were still depending on other reminder cues despite receiving SMS text message or RTMM reminders. Poor network coverage caused low adherence in 1 participant. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial barriers were reported as importantly contributing to low adherence, both with respect to use of ART and proper use of the adherence-monitoring device. This case series illustrates that when introducing new digital adherence monitoring technology, researchers should consider psychosocial barriers and distinguish between adherence to device use and adherence to treatment.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 188 children, each accompanied by their caregivers at Ola During Children's Hospital and Makeni Government Hospital between September and November 2016. Adherence to HAART and Quality of life was assessed using the WHO Quality of life summary questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). We obtained ethical approval from the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee. RESULTS: The study revealed 5.9% adherence amongst paediatric patients, and a strong association of adherent patients(p = 0.019*) to the physical health domain (mean = 64.61 SD = 8.1).

We sought to determine whether a community-based intervention to identify and rapidly treat people living with HIV, and support male circumcision could increase population levels of HIV diagnosis, treatment, viral suppression, and male circumcision in Botswana. METHODS: The Ya Tsie Botswana Combination Prevention Project study was a pair-matched cluster-randomised trial done in 30 communities across Botswana done from Oct 30, 2013, to June 30, 2018. 15 communities were randomly assigned to receive HIV prevention and treatment interventions, including enhanced HIV testing, earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART), and strengthened male circumcision services, and 15 received standard of care. The first primary endpoint of HIV incidence has already been reported. In this Article, we report findings for the second primary endpoint of population uptake of HIV prevention services, as measured by proportion of people known to be HIV-positive or tested HIV-negative in the preceding 12 months; proportion of people living with HIV diagnosed and on ART; proportion of people living with HIV on ART with viral suppression; and proportion of HIV-negative men circumcised. A longitudinal cohort of residents aged 16-64 years from a random, approximately 20% sample of households across the 15 communities was enrolled to assess baseline uptake of study outcomes; we also administered an end-of-study survey to all residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort to provide study end coverage estimates. Differences in intervention uptake over time by randomisation group were tested via paired Student's t test. The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01965470). FINDINGS: In the six communities participating in the end-of-study survey, 2625 residents (n=1304 from standard-of-care communities, n=1321 from intervention communities) were enrolled into the 20% longitudinal cohort at baseline from Oct 30, 2013, to Nov 24, 2015. In the same communities, 10 791 (86%) of 12 489 eligible enumerated residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort participated in the end-of-study survey from March 30, 2017, to Feb 25, 2018 (5896 in intervention and 4895 in standard-of-care communities). At study end, in intervention communities, 1228 people living with HIV (91% of 1353) were on ART; 1166 people living with HIV (88% of 1321 with available viral load) were virally suppressed, and 673 HIV-negative men (40% of 1673) were circumcised in intervention communities. After accounting for baseline differences, at study end the proportion of people living with HIV who were diagnosed was significantly higher in intervention communities (absolute increase of 9% to 93%) compared with standard-of-care communities (absolute increase of 2% to 88%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.08 [95% CI 1.02-1.14], p=0.032). Population levels of ART, viral suppression, and male circumcision increased from baseline in both groups, with greater increases in intervention communities (ART PR 1.12 [95% CI 1.07-1.17], p=0.018; viral suppression 1.13 [1.09-1.17], p=0.017; male circumcision 1.26 [1.17-1.35], p=0.029). INTERPRETATION: It is possible to achieve very high population levels of HIV testing and treatment in a high-prevalence setting. Maintaining these coverage levels over the next decade could substantially reduce HIV transmission and potentially eliminate the epidemic in these areas.

       "  'A maternal vaccine capable of boosting neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses directed against circulating viruses in HIV-infected pregnant women could effectively decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, it is not known if an HIV envelope (Env) vaccine administered to infected pregnant women could enhance autologous virus neutralization and thereby reduce this risk of vertical HIV transmission. Here, we assessed autologous virus NAb responses in maternal plasma samples obtained from AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG) protocols 104 and 102, representing historical phase I safety and immunogenicity trials of recombinant HIV Env subunit vaccines administered to HIV-infected pregnant women (ClinicalTrials registration no. NCT00001041). Maternal HIV Env-specific plasma binding and neutralizing antibody responses were characterized before and after vaccination in 15 AVEG 104 (n = 10 vaccine recipients, n = 5 placebo recipients) and 2 AVEG 102 (n = 1 vaccine recipient, n = 1 placebo recipient) participants. Single-genome amplification (SGA) was used to obtain HIV env gene sequences of autologous maternal viruses for pseudovirus production and neutralization sensitivity testing in pre- and postvaccination plasma of HIV-infected pregnant vaccine recipients (n = 6 gp120, n = 1 gp160) and placebo recipients (n = 3). We detected an increase in Env subunit MN gp120-specific IgG binding in the group of vaccine recipients between the first immunization visit and the last visit at delivery (P = 0.027, 2-sided Wilcoxon test). While no difference was observed in the levels of autologous virus neutralization potency between groups, in both groups maternal plasma collected at delivery more effectively neutralized autologous viruses from early pregnancy than late pregnancy. Immunization strategies capable of further enhancing these autologous virus NAb responses in pregnant women will be important to block vertical transmission of HIV.IMPORTANCE Maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) has effectively reduced but not eliminated the burden of mother-to-child transmission of HIV across the globe, as an estimated 160,000 children were newly infected with HIV in 2018. Thus, additional preventive strategies beyond ART will be required to close the remaining gap and end the pediatric HIV epidemic. A maternal active immunization strategy that synergizes with maternal ART could further reduce infant HIV infections. In this study, we found that two historic HIV Env vaccines did not enhance the ability of HIV-infected pregnant women to neutralize autologous viruses. Therefore, next-generation maternal HIV vaccine candidates must employ alternate approaches to achieve potent neutralizing antibody and perhaps nonneutralizing antibody responses to effectively impede vertical virus transmission. Moreover, these approaches must reflect the broad diversity of HIV strains and widespread availability of ART worldwide.'),\n",

Traditionally, various community and health care organizations have worked to address different stages of PrEP or TasP care. OBJECTIVE: To understand the importance of how HIV prevention organizations providing these services interact to provide the comprehensive care needed for successful HIV and PrEP continuum outcomes. DESIGN: Utilizing an Organizational Network Survey, network ties were examined between formal and informal partnerships among community agencies. SETTING: This study examined community agencies in the current HIV prevention system in Chicago. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two community agencies across the Chicago metropolitan area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using network analysis, this study examined ties between community agencies and assessed perceptions of collaboration and competitiveness in the current HIV prevention system in Chicago. RESULTS: Overall, respondents reported that the current environment of HIV prevention in Chicago was extremely (18.8%), moderately (37.5%), or somewhat collaborative (37.5%) and extremely (68.8%) or moderately competitive (25.0%). The majority of partnerships reported were informal, with less than a quarter being formalized. That said, those who reported formal partnerships reported being satisfied with those relationships. There was a significantly negative association between density and perceived collaboration-grantees experiencing a more collaborative also reported less dense networks. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that, despite perceived competitiveness, agencies are willing to work together and create a cohesive HIV prevention and treatment system. However, more work should be done to foster an environment that can support the formation of partnerships, to improve a coordinated response to providing HIV care, and sustain mutually beneficial relationships.'),\n",

CD8(+) T cells are an important component of the host immune response to HIV-1 and may need to be harnessed if a vaccine is to be effective. CD8(+) T cells recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated viral epitopes and the HLA alleles vary significantly among different ethnic groups. It follows that definition of HIV-1-derived peptides recognized by CD8(+) T cells in the geographically relevant regions will critically guide vaccine development. Here, we study fine details of CD8(+) T-cell responses elicited in HIV-1/2-uninfected individuals in Nairobi, Kenya, who received a candidate vaccine delivering conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins called HIVconsv. Using 10-day cell lines established by in vitro peptide restimulation of cryopreserved PBMC and stably HLA-transfected 721.221/C1R cell lines, we confirm experimentally many already defined epitopes, for a number of epitopes we define the restricting HLA molecule(s) and describe four novel HLA-epitope pairs. We also identify specific dominance patterns, a promiscuous T-cell epitope and a rescue of suboptimal T-cell epitope induction in vivo by its functional variant, which all together inform vaccine design.'),\n",

The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with HIV/AIDS within a Ugandan fishing community in the different physical activity (PA) stages. We also explored differences in variables, motives, and barriers for PA across the stages.Methods: In total, 256 individuals (77 men, 40.5 +/- 10.3 years) completed the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depressive symptoms, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. They were also asked about their most important PA motive and barrier.Results: Seventy-five individuals (29%) were in the (pre-)preparatory stages, 140 (55%) in the action and 41 (16%) in the maintenance stage. Those in the (pre-)preparatory stages had higher PHQ-9 total scores (p < 0.001) and were more likely to report barriers than those in the later stages (p < 0.001). Compared with those in the (pre-)preparatory stage, patients in the action stage experienced less body weakness (p = 0.015).Conclusions: Depression and barriers to PA should be considered in people with HIV/AIDS in low-resource settings when implementing interventions to assist them to become more active.Implications for rehabilitationPeople with HIV/AIDS are among the most physically inactive clinical populations.Clinicians should consider depression when motivating patients with HIV in low resourced settings to become active.Clinicians should consider body weakness when motivating patients with HIV in low resourced settings to become active.'),\n",

However, available data often suffer from differential missingness. For example, population-level HIV viral suppression is the proportion of all HIV-positive persons with suppressed viral replication. Individuals with measured HIV status, and among HIV-positive individuals those with measured viral suppression, likely differ from those without such measurements. METHODS: We discuss three sets of assumptions to identify population-level suppression in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT01864603), a community randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (2013-2017). Using data on nearly 100,000 participants, we compare estimates from (1) an unadjusted approach assuming data are missing-completely-at-random (MCAR); (2) stratification on age group, sex, and community; and (3) targeted maximum likelihood estimation to adjust for a larger set of baseline and time-updated variables. RESULTS: Despite high measurement coverage, estimates of population-level viral suppression varied by identification assumption. Unadjusted estimates were most optimistic: 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%, 54%) of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 80% (95% CI = 78%, 82%) at year 1, 85% (95% CI = 83%, 86%) at year 2, and 85% (95% CI = 83%, 87%) at year 3. Stratifying on baseline predictors yielded slightly lower estimates, and full adjustment reduced estimates meaningfully: 42% (95% CI = 37%, 46%) of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 71% (95% CI = 69%, 73%) at year 1, 76% (95% CI = 74%, 78%) at year 2, and 79% (95% CI = 77%, 81%) at year 3. CONCLUSIONS: Estimation of population-level disease burden and control requires appropriate adjustment for missing data. Even in large studies with limited missingness, estimates relying on the MCAR assumption or baseline stratification should be interpreted cautiously.'),\n",

In 2016, 84 and 86% of people with HIV knew their status in Malawi and Zimbabwe, respectively. However, gaps remain, particularly among men. We investigated awareness and use of, and willingness to self-test for HIV and explored sociodemographic associations before large-scale implementation. METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question. RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2% of men had never tested compared with 16.5% of women (p < 0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age. Past use and awareness of HIVST was very low, 1.2 and 12.6%, respectively. Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1% vs 15.3%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR = 3.74; 95%CI: 1.39-10.03, p < 0.009]), and being >/=25 years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p < 0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR = 3.74; 95%CI: 1.39-10.03, p < 0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up.

We evaluated DNA plasmid versus canarypox virus (ALVAC) primes in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in southern Africa with harmonized trial designs. HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 111 tested DNA plasmid prime by needle or needleless injection device (Biojector) and DNA plasmid plus gp120 protein plus MF59 adjuvant boost. HVTN 100 tested ALVAC prime and ALVAC plus gp120 protein plus MF59 adjuvant boost (same protein/adjuvant as HVTN 111) by needle. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The primary endpoints for this analysis were binding antibody (bAb) responses to HIV antigens (gp120 from strains ZM96, 1086, and TV1; variable 1 and 2 [V1V2] regions of gp120 from strains TV1, 1086, and B.CaseA, as 1086 V1V2 and B.CaseA were correlates of risk in the RV144 efficacy trial), neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to pseudoviruses TV1c8.2 and MW925.26, and cellular responses to vaccine-matched antigens (envelope [Env] from strains ZM96, 1086, and TV1; and Gag from strains LAI and ZM96) at month 6.5, two weeks after the fourth vaccination. Per-protocol cohorts included vaccine recipients from HVTN 100 (n = 186, 60% male, median age 23 years) enrolled between February 9, 2015, and May 26, 2015 and from HVTN 111 (n = 56, 48% male, median age 24 years) enrolled between June 21, 2016, and July 13, 2017. IgG bAb response rates were 100% to 3 Env gp120 antigens in both trials. Response rates to V1V2 were lower and similar in both trials except to vaccine-matched 1086 V1V2, with rates significantly higher for the DNA-primed regimen than the ALVAC-primed regimen: 96.6% versus 72.7% (difference = 23.9%, 95% CI 15.6%-32.2%, p < 0.001). Among positive responders, bAb net mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was significantly higher with the DNA-primed regimen than ALVAC-primed for 1086 V1V2 (geometric mean [GM] 2,833.3 versus 1,200.9; ratio = 2.36, 95% CI 1.42-3.92, p < 0.001) and B.CaseA V1V2 (GM 2314.0 versus 744.6, ratio = 3.11, 95% CI 1.51-6.38, p = 0.002). nAb response rates were >98% in both trials, with significantly higher 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) among DNA-primed positive responders (n = 53) versus ALVAC-primed (n = 182) to tier 1A MW965.26 (GM 577.7 versus 265.7, ratio = 2.17, 95% CI 1.67-2.83, p < 0.001) and to TV1c8.2 (GM 187.3 versus 100.4, ratio = 1.87, 95% CI 1.48-2.35, p < 0.001).

Understanding FBWs' risk profiles is central to designing targeted HIV prevention interventions for them. This systematic review describes the socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors for HIV transmission among FBWs in SSA. METHODS: We searched six databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Popline, Embase and additionally the World Health Organization's WHOLIS database for grey literature between July and September 2017. Inclusion criteria were reporting (1) primary socio-demographic or behavioral data; on (2) women who sold or delivered drinks to clients; (3) in establishments serving alcohol; (4) in SSA. We excluded studies not presenting separate data on FBWs. We extracted quantitative and qualitative data from the selected studies and conducted a qualitative synthesis of findings. RESULTS: We found 4565 potentially eligible articles, including duplicates. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we retained 19 articles. FBWs often migrated from rural to urban areas due to economic need or social marginalization. They began bar-based transactional sex due to low wages, peer pressure and to increase financial independence. FBWs had high HIV risk awareness but low agency to negotiate condom use, particularly with regular partners or when offered higher prices for condomless sex. FBWs were also vulnerable to violence and stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: FBWs are a vulnerable population for HIV infection. Despite social stigmatization and elevated risk of contracting STIs, bar work remains attractive because it enables unskilled women to both, make a living and maintain some independence. FBWs face HIV-related risk factors at the individual, community and societal level and may benefit from biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions.\"),\n",

However, data on the risk of recurrent VTE in this population are lacking, although this question is more important for clinical practice. This study aims to estimate the risk of recurrent VTE in PWH compared to controls and to identify risk factors for recurrence within this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PWH with a first VTE were derived from the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (ATHENA) cohort (2003-2015), a nationwide ongoing cohort following up PWH in care in the Netherlands. Uninfected controls were derived from the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) follow-up study (1999-2003), a cohort of patients with a first VTE who initially participated in a case-control study in the Netherlands who were followed up for recurrent VTE. Selection was limited to persons with an index VTE suffering from deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). Participants were followed from withdrawal of anticoagulation to VTE recurrence, loss to follow-up, death, or end of study. We estimated incidence rates, cumulative incidence (accounting for competing risk of death) and hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, and whether the index event was provoked or unprovoked. When analyzing risk factors among PWH, the main focus of analysis was the role of immune markers (cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4]+ T-cell count). There were 153 PWH (82% men, median 48 years) and 4,005 uninfected controls (45% men, median 49 years) with a first VTE (71% unprovoked in PWH, 34% unprovoked in controls) available for analysis. With 40 VTE recurrences during 774 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) in PWH and 635 VTE recurrences during 20,215 PYFU in controls, the incidence rates were 5.2 and 3.1 per 100 PYFU (HR: 1.70, 95% CI 1.23-2.36, p = 0.003). VTE consistently recurred more frequently per 100 PYFU in PWH in all predefined subgroups of men (5.6 versus 4.8), women (3.6 versus 1.9), and unprovoked (6.0 versus 5.2) or provoked (3.1 versus 2.1) first VTE. After adjustment, the VTE recurrence risk was higher in PWH compared to controls in the first year after anticoagulant discontinuation (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.04-2.70, p = 0.03) with higher cumulative incidences in PWH at 1 year (12.5% versus 5.6%) and 5 years (23.4% versus 15.3%) of follow-up. VTE recurred less frequently in PWH who were more immunodeficient at the first VTE, marked by a better CD4+ T-cell recovery on antiretroviral therapy and during anticoagulant therapy for the first VTE (adjusted HR: 0.81 per 100 cells/mm3 increase, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, p = 0.02). Sensitivity analyses addressing potential sources of bias confirmed our principal analyses. The main study limitations are that VTEs were adjudicated differently in the cohorts and that diagnostic practices changed during the 20-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the risk of recurrent VTE was elevated in PWH compared to controls. Among PWH, recurrence risk appeared to decrease with greater CD4+ T-cell recovery after a first VTE. This is relevant when deciding to (dis)continue anticoagulant therapy in PWH with otherwise unprovoked first VTE.'),\n",

Changes in gene expression were dependent on cell/tissue type, stage of infection, viremia, and treatment status. Some cell types, notably CD4(+) T cells, exhibit upregulation of cell cycle, interferon-related, and apoptosis genes consistent with depletion. Others, including CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells, exhibit perturbed function in the absence of direct infection with HIV. Dysregulation is greatest during acute infection.

Results: HIV enhances susceptibility to opportunistic eye infections, has direct pathogenic effects, and places patients at risk of immune recovery inflammatory syndromes in previously infected eyes after starting highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Widespread availability of HAART has resulted in a decrease of infectious ocular conditions such as cytomegalovirus retinitis, toxoplasmic retinitis, squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and microvascular retinopathy. However, large coexisting burdens of tuberculosis, herpesvirus infection and syphilis (among others) continue to contribute to the burden of ocular disease, especially in low-resource settings. Growing risks of cataract, retinopathy and retinal nerve fiber thinning can affect patients with chronic HIV on HAART; thought due to chronic inflammation and immune activation.

These results and HIV incidence were used to calibrate a risk equation model to estimate the population attributable fraction of new HIV infections due to RAI (PAFRAI ) accounting for uncertainty in parameter assumptions. RESULTS: Receptive anal intercourse prevalence (overall: 32%, city range: 19%-60%) and RAI fraction (overall: 27%, city range: 18%-34%) were high overall and across cities, and positively associated with exchange sex. RAI accounted for an estimated 41% (uncertainty range: 18%-55%) of new infections overall (city range: 21%-57%). Variability in PAFRAI estimates was most influenced by uncertainty in the estimate of the per-act increased risk of RAI relative to RVI and the number of sex acts. CONCLUSION: Receptive anal intercourse may contribute disproportionately to new heterosexually acquired HIV infections among at-risk low-income women in the USA, meaning that tools to prevent HIV transmission during RAI are warranted. The number of RVI and RAI acts should also be collected to monitor heterosexually acquired HIV infections.'),\n",

Little is known however about the natural variability in these Vpu functions among the genetically diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. We collected Vpu isolates from 332 treatment-naive individuals living with chronic HIV-1 infection in Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Canada. Together, these Vpu isolates represent four major HIV-1 group M subtypes (A [n = 63], B [n = 84], C [n = 94], and D [n = 59]) plus intersubtype recombinants and uncommon strains (n = 32). The ability of each Vpu clone to downregulate endogenous CD4 and tetherin was quantified using flow cytometry following transfection into an immortalized T-cell line and compared to that of a reference Vpu clone derived from HIV-1 subtype B NL4.3. Overall, the median CD4 downregulation function of natural Vpu isolates was similar to that of NL4.3 (1.01 [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.86 to 1.18]), while the median tetherin downregulation function was moderately lower than that of NL4.3 (0.90 [0.79 to 0.97]). Both Vpu functions varied significantly among HIV-1 subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.0001). Specifically, subtype C clones exhibited the lowest CD4 and tetherin downregulation activities, while subtype D and B clones were most functional for both activities. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms associated with CD4 or tetherin downregulation function and validated six of these using site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight the marked extent to which Vpu function varies among global HIV-1 strains, raising the possibility that natural variation in this accessory protein may contribute to viral pathogenesis and/or spread.IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral spread by downregulating CD4 and BST-2/tetherin on the surface of infected cells. Natural variability in these Vpu functions may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, but this has not been investigated among the diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. In this study, we found that Vpu function differs significantly among HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D. On average, subtype C clones displayed the lowest ability to downregulate both CD4 and tetherin, while subtype B and D clones were more functional. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms that associate with functional differences among HIV-1 isolates and subtypes. Our study suggests that genetic diversity in Vpu may play an important role in the differential pathogenesis and/or spread of HIV-1.'),\n",

These children are living with a compromised immune system, are vulnerable to opportunistic infections and subsequent hearing loss. However, there is limited research on the nature and extent of this sensory impairment amongst school-aged children. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine an audiological profile of a cohort of school-aged children attending an antiretroviral (ARV) clinic, describing the occurrence of hearing loss and nature in terms of degree, type, configuration and symmetry. METHODS: A non-experimental descriptive exploratory study was conducted, where 30 children aged between 6 and 12 years underwent diagnostic audiological assessments. Audiological procedures included case history, medical record review, otoscopic examination, immittance audiometry, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and neurological auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing. The results were analysed descriptively using SPSS version 22 software. RESULTS: The results indicated abnormal otoscopic findings in half the participants, and consequently type C tympanograms were the most common. Of the 28 participants who could be assessed with pure-tone audiometry, 15 (54%) showed a hearing loss. A bilateral rising mild, conductive hearing loss was predominant. Thirteen (43%) of the participants could not be tested using DPOAE because of outer and middle-ear pathology. Neurological ABR testing revealed an abnormality in 18 (60%) of the participants suggesting the sensitivity of the ABR to detect subtle neurological changes. CONCLUSION: Half the children in this study showed hearing loss, which has serious implications for the holistic management of the children within the health and educational contexts. Therefore, there is a need for audiological monitoring of children with HIV and AIDS.'),\n",

Given their separate roles in immune dysregulation, our objective was to characterise the impact that SCD has on the presentation and progression of paediatric HIV. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study (study period 2004-2018). Cases of HIV + and SCD-afflicted patients (HIV+/SCD+) were obtained via electronic chart review from a paediatric HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda and matched 1:3 with HIV + controls without SCD (HIV+/SCD-). RESULTS: Thirty-five HIV+/SCD + subjects and 95 HIV+/SCD- controls were analysed (39% female (51/130), age 3.6 years (SD3.9)). At baseline, WHO clinical stage (64% total cohort Stage III/IV) and nutritional status (9.4% severe acute malnutrition) were similar for both groups, whereas HIV+/SCD + had higher though non-significant baseline CD4 count (1036 (SD713) vs 849 (SD638) cells/microlitre, P = 0.20, two-tailed t-test). There were 19 deaths, 6 (17%) HIV+/SCD + and 13 (14%) HIV+/SCD-, with unadjusted/adjusted models showing no significant difference. Nutritional progression and clinical stage progression showed no significant differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a slower rate of treatment failures in the HIV+/SCD + cohort (P = 0.11, log-rank survival test). Trajectory analysis showed that in the time period analysed, the HIV+/SCD + cohort showed a more rapid rise and higher total CD4 count (P = 0.012, regression analysis). CONCLUSION: The study suggests that SCD does not adversely affect the progression of HIV in patients on ART. Further, HIV+/SCD + achieved higher CD4 counts and fewer HIV treatment failures, suggesting physiological effects due to SCD might mitigate HIV progression.'),\n",

The fixed-dose combination tablet of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as PrEP for adults in 2012. Since then, recognition has been increasing that adolescents at risk for acquiring HIV can benefit from PrEP. In 2018, FDA approved revised labeling for TDF/FTC that expanded the indication for PrEP to include adolescents weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg) who are at risk for acquiring HIV. In 2019, FDA approved the combination product tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC as PrEP for adolescents and adults weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg), excluding those at risk for acquiring HIV through receptive vaginal sex. This exclusion is due to the lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of TAF/FTC in cisgender women.Clinical providers who evaluate adolescents for PrEP use must consider certain topics that are unique to the adolescent population. Important considerations related to adolescents include PrEP safety data, legal issues about consent for clinical care and confidentiality, the therapeutic partnership with adolescents and their parents or guardians, the approach to the adolescent patient's clinical visit, and medication initiation, adherence, and persistence during adolescence. Overall, data support the safety of PrEP for adolescents. PrEP providers should be familiar with the statutes and regulations about the provision of health care to minors in their states. Providers should partner with the adolescent patient for PrEP decisions, recognizing the adolescent's autonomy to the extent allowable by law and including parents in the conversation about PrEP when it is safe and reasonable to do so. A comprehensive approach to adolescent health is recommended, including considering PrEP as one possible component of providing medical care to adolescents who inject drugs or engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for acquiring HIV. PrEP adherence declined over time in the studies evaluating PrEP among adolescents, a trend that also has been observed among adult patients. Clinicians should implement strategies to address medication adherence as a routine part of prescribing PrEP; more frequent clinical follow-up is one possible approach.PrEP is an effective HIV prevention tool for protecting adolescents at risk for HIV acquisition. For providers, unique considerations that are part of providing PrEP to adolescents include the possible need for more frequent, supportive interactions to promote medication adherence. Recommendations for PrEP medical management and additional resources for providers are available in the U.S. Public Health Service clinical practice guideline Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States - 2017 Update and the clinical providers' supplement Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States - 2017 Update: Clinical Providers' Supplement (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/clinicians/prevention/prep.html).\"),\n",

Despite multiple contacts between postpartum women and healthcare providers at health facilities, modern contraceptive use during postpartum period remains low even among women with intentions to limit or delay childbearing. We estimated postpartum modern contraceptive use, unmet need and factors associated with modern contraceptive use among HIV positive women attending mother-baby HIV care points. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, between April and May 2016, among HIV positive women attending postpartum care at six health facilities in Kabarole district, Uganda. Health facilities were stratified by level prior to selecting participants using systematic sampling. We administered structured questionnaires to women who had delivered within the last two to 18 months. Women who reported current use of a modern method were categorized as modern contraceptive users. Women not using but wanted to stop childbearing or space childbirth by at least 2 years were considered to have unmet need for modern contraception. We estimated a modified Poisson regression model to examine variations in the use of modern methods by various characteristics of participants. RESULTS: We interviewed 369 women. Forty percent of them were using a modern method, with injectables being the most widely used. A third (33%) of the women had unmet need for modern methods, with unmet need for spacing (24%) being higher than for limiting births (9%). Modern contraceptive use was significantly higher among women who had delivered seven or more months earlier (Adj.PR = 2.02; CI: 1.49, 2.74); women who were counseled on family planning during antenatal care (Adj.PR = 1.53; CI: 1.07, 2.18); those who obtained methods through the care points (Adj.PR =2.27; CI: 1.32, 3.90); and those who jointly made decisions regarding childbearing with their partners (Adj.PR = 1.49; CI: 1.02, 2.17). CONCLUSION: Use of modern contraceptives was low while unmet need was high among postpartum women living with HIV. The findings suggest that there are gaps which indicate the need to strengthen contraceptive service delivery at these care-points. Providing family planning counseling early would improve uptake of contraception upon resumption of menses and sexual activity.'),\n",

Data regarding the safety of IMDs in people living with HIV (PLWH) are limited. We describe outcomes in all PLWH prescribed these agents from 2000--2019 at two academic medical centers. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We systematically identified and reviewed charts of all PLWH receiving IMDs. We defined a treatment episode as an uninterrupted period on an IMD regimen. We quantified infections, blips (detectable plasma HIV RNA following an undetectable result), and virologic failure (progression from plasma HIV RNA <200 copies/ml to two consecutive values >200 copies/ml despite ART). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients contributed 110 treatment episodes. Rheumatologic comorbidities were the most frequent indication. The most common IMD classes were TNF inhibitors, antimetabolites, and checkpoint inhibitors. Ninety percent of treatment episodes involved concomitant ART. Median pretreatment CD4 T-cell count was 609 cells/mul (IQR 375--861). Among 51 treatment episodes on ART with undetectable pretreatment plasma HIV RNA, HIV became detectable within 1 year in 21 of 51 cases (41.2%); there were no instances of virologic failure. Compared with other agents, treatment episodes involving checkpoint inhibitors were more likely to involve a blip (77.8 vs. 33.3%, P = 0.015). Thirteen treatment episodes (11.8%) were associated with concomitant infection; none was attributed to IMDs by the treating clinician. CONCLUSION: PLWH treated with IMDs should be monitored carefully for virologic blips and incident infections. Checkpoint inhibitors may be associated with a higher rate of viral blips, although the clinical significance is unclear.'),\n",

Current therapeutic drugs use the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) as a competitive inhibitor against HBV reverse transcriptase (HBV-RT), an essential enzyme pivotally involved in viral replication. Unfortunately, this treatment still causes the development of resistant variants of HBV against NAs. As HBV-RT is homologous to the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT), it is reasonable to treat HBV-RT with anti-HIV drugs. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the structural dynamics and susceptibility of the known anti-HIV drugs (stavudine [d4T], didanosine [DDI], and zidovudine [ZDV]) against HBV-RT enzyme in comparison to the anti-HBV drug lamivudine (3TC) and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) substrate using several computational approaches. The DeltaGbindresidue calculations revealed that seven polar residues (K32, R41, D83, S85, D205, N236, and K239) and three hydrophobic residues (A86, A87, and F88) of HBV-RT as well as the adjacent DNA strands play an important role in the ligand binding. In addition, the H-bond pattern of d4T is similar to that of 3TC, especially at the residues A86 and A87. Such interactions promote the favorable conformation of ligand in the HBV-RT binding pocket, while the several different conformations of ligand are found in the unbound state. The predicted binding free energy results based on QM/MM-GBSA and MM/GB(PB)SA methods suggested that the susceptibility towards HBV-RT of d4T and ZDV is higher than that of 3TC and dTTP. Altogether, this work sheds light on the potentiality of d4T and ZDV as a promising drug for HBV-infected patients harboring 3TC resistance.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.'),\n",

One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.'),\n",

We assessed relationships between ART drug class and weight change among treatment-naive PWH initiating ART in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). METHODS: Adult, treatment-naive PWH in NA-ACCORD initiating integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART on/after 1 January 2007 were followed through 31 December 2016. Multivariate linear mixed effects models estimated weight up to five years after ART initiation, adjusting for age, sex, race, cohort site, HIV acquisition mode, treatment year, and baseline weight, plasma HIV-1 RNA level and CD4(+) cell count. Due to shorter follow-up for PWH receiving newer INSTI drugs, weights for specific INSTIs were estimated at two years. Secondary analyses using logistic regression and all covariates from primary analyses assessed factors associated with >10% weight gain at two and five years. RESULTS: Among 22,972 participants, 87% were male, and 41% were white. 49% started NNRTI-, 31% started PI- and 20% started INSTI-based regimens (1624 raltegravir (RAL), 2085 elvitegravir (EVG) and 929 dolutegravir (DTG)). PWH starting INSTI-based regimens had mean estimated five-year weight change of +5.9kg, compared to +3.7kg for NNRTI and +5.5kg for PI. Among PWH starting INSTI drugs, mean estimated two-year weight change was +7.2kg for DTG, +5.8kg for RAL and +4.1kg for EVG. Women, persons with lower baseline CD4(+) cell counts, and those initiating INSTI-based regimens had higher odds of >10% body weight increase at two years (adjusted odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.20 to 1.56 vs. NNRTI). CONCLUSIONS: PWH initiating INSTI-based regimens gained, on average, more weight compared to NNRTI-based regimens. This phenomenon may reflect heterogeneous effects of ART agents on body weight regulation that require further exploration.'),\n",

DESIGN: These bsAbs are based on patient-derived antibodies targeting the conserved gp41 stump of HIV Env, and also incorporate a high-affinity single chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting the activating receptor CD16 on NK cells. Overall, we expect the bsAbs to provide increased affinity and avidity over their corresponding mAbs, allowing for improved ADCC activity against Env-expressing target cells. METHODS: bsAbs and their corresponding mAbs were expressed in 293T cells and purified. The binding of bsAbs and mAbs to their intended targets was determined using Bio-Layer Interferometry, as well as flow cytometry based binding assays on in-vitro infected cells. The ability of these bsAbs to improve NK cell activity against HIV-infected cells was tested using in-vitro co-culture assays, using flow cytometry and calcein release to analyse NK cell degranulation and target cell killing, respectively. RESULTS: The bsAbs-bound gp41 with similar affinity to their corresponding mAbs had increased affinity for CD16. The bsAbs also bound to primary CD4 T cells infected in vitro with two different strains of HIV. In addition, the bsAbs induce increased NK cell degranulation and killing of autologous HIV-infected CD4 T cells.

       "  \"Background: Great strides have been made in decreasing paediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, new paediatric HIV infections decreased by 84% between 2009 and 2015. This achievement is a result of a strong political will and the rapid evolution of the country's prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) guidelines. Objectives: In this paper we report on the implementation of a large PMTCT programme in Soweto, South Africa. Methods: We reviewed routinely collected PMTCT data from 13 healthcare facilities, for the period 2002-2015. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) and the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate at early infant diagnosis were evaluated. Results: In total, 360 751 pregnant women attended the facilities during the review period, and the HIV prevalence remained high throughout at around 30%. The proportion of PWLHIV presenting with a known HIV status increased from 14.3% in 2009 when the indicator was first collected to 45% in 2015, p < 0.001. In 2006, less than 10% of the PWLHIV were initiated on ART, increasing to 88% by 2011. The MTCT rate decreased from 6.9% in 2007 to under 1% from 2013 to 2015, p < 0.001. Conclusion: The achievements in decreasing paediatric HIV infections have been hailed as one of the greatest public health achievements of our times. While there are inherent limitations with using routinely collected aggregate data, the Soweto data reflect progress made in the implementation of PMTCT programmes in South Africa. Progress with PMTCT has, however, not been accompanied by a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women.\"),\n",

       "  \"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Heavy drinking is associated with increased risk of incident HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). Past studies suggest that this association may be due to the tendency for intoxication to interfere with condom use. However, research on potential causal mechanisms explaining this relationship has been limited primarily to laboratory studies. In this study, we tested several potential mediators of the relationship between alcohol use level and HIV risk behavior. DESIGN: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods conducted over a 30-day period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS/CASES: MSM (n = 100) in the northeastern United States. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed daily diary surveys and up to six experience sampling surveys randomly prompted throughout the day. FINDINGS: Very heavy levels of drinking (12+ drinks) increased the odds of engaging in any sex [odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, P < 0.001]. Coefficient products and 95% confidence intervals indicated that both subjective sexual arousal (OR = 1.52, P < 0.001) and sex intentions (OR = 1.74, P < 0.001) significantly mediated the association between very heavy drinking and the odds of sex. When participants reported sex, the odds of engaging in high-risk condomless anal sex (CAS) increased incrementally after drinking heavily (five to 11 drinks; OR = 3.27, P = 0.006) and very heavily (12+ drinks; OR = 4.42, P < 0.001). Only subjective sexual arousal significantly mediated the association between alcohol use level and high-risk CAS (OR = 1.16, P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in subjective sexual arousal after drinking heavily appear to partly account for alcohol-related HIV risk behaviors in the daily lives of men who have sex with men. Alcohol's role in strengthening motivationally consistent emotional states may therefore play a more important role in facilitating alcohol-involved HIV risk than explicit sexual motivation.\"),\n",

We designed an intervention, Mobile Antiretroviral Therapy and HIV care (MAP-HC) in rural southwestern Uganda aimed to reduce travel distance and hypothesized that MAP-HC would improve ART adherence and rates of viral load suppression. The study was conducted at two district hospitals, among patients who lived >5 km from the hospital. For each hospital, we identified 4 health centers in the catchment area to serve as site for the mobile pharmacy. Each site was visited once a month to provide ART refills and adherence counseling. We measured patient waiting time, adherence and viral load suppression before and after the intervention. The proportion of patients who missed an ART dose in the last 30 days dropped from 20% to 8.5% at 12 months post-intervention (p = 0.009) and those with detectable viral load dropped from 19.9% to 7.4% (p = 0.001), however, mean waiting time increased from 4.48 to 4.76 h (p = 0.13). Mobile pharmacy intervention in rural Uganda is feasible and resulted in improvement in adherence and viral load suppression. Although it did not reduce patient waiting time at the clinic, we recommend scale-up in rural areas where patients face transportation challenges.'),\n",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) co-infections likely exacerbate inflammatory-related diseases. OBJECTIVE: To determine if presence of detectable CMV or EBV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is associated with non-AIDS events among PWH receiving modern ART. DESIGN: We performed a case--control study of PWH starting ART and HIV-suppressed at year 1 and thereafter, 140 cases who experienced non-AIDS events and 305 matched controls. Events included myocardial infarction, stroke, malignancy, serious bacterial infection or death. METHODS: Blood samples were studied pre-ART, 1-year post-ART and pre-event. Controls had an event-free follow-up equal or greater than cases. CMV and EBV DNA levels were measured in PBMC. Conditional logistic regression analysis assessed associations and adjusted for relevant covariates; Spearman's correlations compared CMV and EBV DNA levels with other biomarkers. RESULTS: CMV DNA was detected in PBMC of 25% of participants, EBV DNA was detected in more than 90%. Higher EBV DNA levels were associated with increased risk of events at all time points (odds ratio (OR) per one IQR = 1.5-1.7, all P < 0.009). At year 1, detectable CMV DNA was associated with increased risk of events in most adjusted models (OR = 1.4-1.8, P values ranging 0.03-0.17). Higher levels of CMV and EBV DNA correlated with multiple inflammatory markers and lower CD4/CD8 ratio. CONCLUSION: In PWH starting ART, detection of CMV and EBV DNA in PBMC was associated with development of non-AIDS events. Clinical trials will be needed to understand causal mechanisms and ways to interrupt them.\"),\n",

The objective of this study was to determine if beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition measured by [(18)F] AV-45 (florbetapir) positron emission tomography (PET) is increased in older HIV+ individuals compared to HIV- individuals. Forty-eight HIV+ and 25 HIV- individuals underwent [(18)F] AV-45 PET imaging. [(18)F] AV-45 binding to Abeta was measured by standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) relative to the cerebellum in 16 cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Global and regional cortical SUVRs were compared by (1) serostatus, (2) HAND stage, and (3) age decade, comparing individuals in their 50s and > 60s. There were no differences in median global cortical SUVR stratified by HIV serostatus or HAND stage. The proportion of HIV+ participants in their 50s with elevated global amyloid uptake (SUVR > 1.40) was significantly higher than the proportion in HIV- participants (67% versus 25%, p = 0.04), and selected regional SUVR values were also higher (p < 0.05) in HIV+ compared to HIV- participants in their 50s. However, these group differences were not seen in participants in their 60s. In conclusion, PET imaging found no differences in overall global Abeta deposition stratified by HIV serostatus or HAND stage. Although there was some evidence of increased Abeta deposition in HIV+ individuals in their 50s compared to HIV- individuals which might indicate premature aging, the most parsimonious explanation for this is the relatively small sample size in this cross-sectional cohort study.'),\n",

We examined values and opinions about the acceptability of using electronic healthcare predictive analytics (eHPA) to promote HIV prevention in men who have sex with men (MSM). Our aims were twofold: (I) to evaluate the perspectives of MSM with diverse race/ethnicity and age on the acceptability of predictive analytics to determine individual HIV risk and (II) to determine acceptability of having targeted prevention messaging based upon those risk estimates sent directly to the consumer.Method: Two of the authors facilitated 12 focus groups (n=57) with adult MSM without HIV, living in NYC. Groups were divided by ethnicity (Black, Latino, and White) and age (under 35 and 35 and over). Participants were recruited through HIV prevention sites, community-based organizations, social media, and Internet sites that serve these communities. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze the data with Dedoose. Results: We identified six main themes related to acceptability: (I) reach, relevance, and potential uptake of using predictive analytics to establish HIV risk and deliver targeted prevention messaging; (II) patient-provider communication; (III) public health and individual rights; (IV) perceptions of intervention effectiveness; (V) electronic health data security; and (VI) stigma. Within each thematic domain, MSM discussed concerns, benefits, and provided recommendations for implementation. Conclusions: MSM in this study were supportive of the use of \"big data\" and technology to reach marginalized populations and improve public health, yet expressed concerns about the relevance, effectiveness, and security eHPA. Efforts to advance eHPA for HIV prevention should address these concerns, especially among the most-at-risk communities of color. Development of eHPA for HIV prevention should involve targeted messaging that addresses specific concerns regarding eHPA security, accuracy, and relevance.'),\n",

However, barriers to healthcare and a lack of data regarding PrEP efficacy among transgender persons limits use. A related issue is whether a drug-drug interaction (DDI) exists between gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) and PrEP. Recently, small pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess this interaction. AREAS COVERED: This review will assess the pharmacology of PrEP agents, existing data regarding potential DDIs between GAHT and PrEP, and hypothetical mechanisms for these DDIs. A summary will be provided on implications for PrEP use among transgender persons. EXPERT OPINION: Theoretically, DDIs are not expected between GAHT and PrEP. However, among transgender women (TGW) on GAHT, small studies identified a minor DDI between GAHT and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC), with TFV/FTC exposures ~12-27% lower among TGW vs. cisgender men. The mechanism of DDIs is unclear and requires further study. For perspective, median TFV/FTC concentrations were still within the range of median concentrations reported across controlled pharmacokinetic studies. TFV-disphosphate/FTC-triphosphate concentrations were similar between TGW and cisgender men. In summary, TDF/FTC likely reaches protective concentrations and should continue to be offered as PrEP for transgender persons.'),\n",

The aim was to reach these targets by 2020. We assessed the feasibility of achieving the first two targets, and the corresponding 81% ART coverage target, as part of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 071 Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission (PopART) community-randomized trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study population was individuals aged >/=15 years living in 14 urban and peri-urban \"PopART intervention\" communities in Zambia and South Africa (SA), with a total population of approximately 600,000 and approximately 15% adult HIV prevalence. Community HIV care providers (CHiPs) delivered the PopART intervention during 2014-2017. This was a combination HIV prevention package including universal home-based HIV testing, referral of HIV-positive individuals to government HIV clinic services that offered universal ART (Arm A) or ART according to national guidelines (Arm B), and revisits to HIV-positive individuals to support linkage to HIV care and retention on ART. The intervention was delivered in 3 \"rounds,\" each about 15 months long, during which CHiPs visited all households and aimed to contact all individuals aged >/=15 years at least once. In Arm A in Round 3 (R3), 67% (41,332/61,402) of men and 86% (56,345/65,896) of women in Zambia and 56% (17,813/32,095) of men and 71% (24,461/34,514) of women in SA participated in the intervention, among 193,907 residents aged >/=15 years. Following participation, HIV status was known by 90% of men and women in Zambia and by 78% of men and 85% of women in SA. The median time from CHiP referral of HIV-positive individuals to ART initiation was approximately 3 months. By the end of R3, an estimated 95% of HIV-positive women and 85% of HIV-positive men knew their HIV status, and among these individuals, approximately 90% of women and approximately 85% of men were on ART. ART coverage among all HIV-positive individuals was approximately 85% in women and approximately 75% in men, up from about 45% at the start of the study. ART coverage was lowest among men aged 18 to 34 and women aged 15 to 24 years, and among mobile individuals/in-migrants. Findings from Arm B were similar. The main limitations to our study were that estimates of testing and treatment coverage among men relied on considerable extrapolation because, in each round, approximately one-third of men did not participate in the PopART intervention; that our findings are for a service delivery model that was relatively intensive; and that we did not have comparable data from the 7 \"standard-of-care\" (Arm C) communities. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that very high HIV testing and treatment coverage can be achieved through persistent delivery of universal testing, facilitated linkage to HIV care, and universal treatment services. The ART coverage target of 81% was achieved overall, after 4 years of delivery of the PopART intervention, though important gaps remained among men and young people. Our findings are consistent with previously reported findings from southern and east Africa, extending their generalisability to urban settings with high rates of in-migration and mobility and to Zambia and SA.

Two were identified as persons with a history of injection drug use (IDU) and named each other as syringe-sharing partners, prompting an investigation into a possible HIV cluster among persons with a history of IDU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TDH and public health staff members in eastern Tennessee collaborated to implement procedures outlined in TDH's HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) Outbreak Response Plan, including conducting enhanced interviewing and using a preestablished database for data collection and management. To complement contact tracing and enhanced interviewing, TDH partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct molecular HIV analyses. RESULTS: By June 27, 2017, the investigation had identified 31 persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection; 8 (26%) self-reported IDU, 4 of whom were also men who have sex with men (MSM). Of the remaining 23 persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection, 10 were MSM who did not report IDU, 9 reported high-risk heterosexual contact, and 4 had other or unknown risk factors. Molecular analysis of the 14 HIV-1 polymerase genes (including 7 of the 8 persons self-reporting IDU) revealed 3 distinct molecular clusters, one of which included 3 persons self-reporting IDU. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This investigation highlights the importance of implementing an established Outbreak Response Plan and using HIV molecular analyses in the event of a transmission cluster or outbreak investigations. Future HIV outbreak surveillance will include using Global Hepatitis Outbreak Surveillance Technology to identify HCV gene sequences as a potential harbinger for HIV transmission networks.\"),\n",

Fostemsavir is the prodrug of temsavir, a first-in-class investigational HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 3 trial in 23 countries, we enrolled patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in two cohorts, according to their remaining treatment options. In the first cohort, we assigned (in a 3:1 ratio) patients who had the option of using at least one fully active, approved antiretroviral drug in at least one but no more than two antiretroviral classes to add either fostemsavir (at a dose of 600 mg twice daily) or placebo to their failing regimen for 8 days, followed by open-label fostemsavir plus optimized background therapy (randomized cohort). In the second cohort, patients who had no remaining antiretroviral options were started on open-label fostemsavir plus optimized background therapy on day 1 (nonrandomized cohort). The primary end point was the mean change in the HIV-1 RNA level from day 1 through day 8 in the randomized cohort. RESULTS: A total of 371 patients were treated, including 272 in the randomized cohort and 99 in the nonrandomized cohort.

At week 48, a virologic response (HIV-1 RNA level, <40 copies per milliliter) had occurred in 54% of the patients in the randomized cohort and in 38% of those in the nonrandomized cohort; the mean increase in the CD4+ T-cell count was 139 cells per cubic millimeter and 64 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively. Adverse events led to the discontinuation of fostemsavir in 7% of the patients. In the randomized cohort, glycoprotein 120 (gp120) substitutions were found in 20 of 47 patients (43%) with virologic failure. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection with limited therapy options, those who received fostemsavir had a significantly greater decrease in the HIV-1 RNA level than those who received placebo during the first 8 days. Efficacy was sustained through 48 weeks. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and GSK/ViiV Healthcare; BRIGHTE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02362503.).'),\n",

METHODS: PLWH who were at least 18 years old and taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing ART were prospectively recruited and enrolled from a clinical cohort and followed longitudinally (up to three visits over 48 weeks). With log-transformed TFV-DP concentrations in DBSs as the outcome, mixed-model regression analyses were used to assess associations between self-reported 3 month ART adherence, race and other clinical covariates (gender, age, BMI, CD4+ T cell count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, haematocrit, duration on current ART and anchor drug class) on TFV-DP in DBSs. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-seven participants (1150 person-visits) were analysed. Adjusting for race and other clinical covariates, every 10% increase in self-reported 3 month ART adherence was associated with an average TFV-DP concentration increase in DBSs of 28% (95% CI: 24%-32%; P < 0.0001). In the same model, female participants had 20% (95% CI: 3%-40%; P = 0.02) higher TFV-DP concentrations in DBSs, compared with male participants, and every 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a decrease in TFV-DP concentration in DBSs by 2% (95% CI: -3% to -1%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Individual patient characteristics were predictive of TFV-DP concentration in DBSs in PLWH receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based ART. Future research to incorporate these predictors into the interpretation of this ART adherence biomarker, and to establish whether these associations extend to PLWH taking tenofovir alafenamide-containing ART, is needed.'),\n",

To determine if this translates into increased frequency of EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC), we evaluated molecular profiles of gastric cancer (GC) in Zambia. Patients with GC or premalignant gastric lesions were enrolled in Lusaka, Zambia. We used patients without any of these lesions as a control group. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) on tumor tissue was used to identify EBVaGC. To identify the microsatellite unstable subtype, immunofluorescence staining for MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) was used. Exposure to EBV and HIV was assessed serologically. We enrolled 369 patients (median age 52 years [IQR 41-65]; 198 (54%) female). Of these, 72 (20%) had GC and 35 (9%) had gastric premalignant lesions (PL). CISH identified EBVaGC in 5/44 (11%) of those with adequate tissue, while MLH1 loss was identified in 29/45 (64%). Both GC and PL were associated with the highest titers of antibodies to Early antigen-diffuse (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.1, P = .048 and OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-12.9, P = .03, respectively) at high concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was associated with a range of antibodies to EBV, but not with any cancer subtype. Despite the association of HIV with persistent EBV, the proportion of EBVaGC in Zambia is similar to populations with a low prevalence of HIV infection. The proportion of microsatellite unstable tumors may be higher than other populations.'),\n",

We evaluated the potential of real-time EAM (transferred via cellular signal) and standard EAM (downloaded via USB cable) in rural Uganda to inform individually differentiated viral load testing strategies by applying machine learning approaches. METHODS: We evaluated an observational cohort of persons living with HIV and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) who were monitored longitudinally with standard EAM from 2005 to 2011 and real-time EAM from 2011 to 2015. Super learner, an ensemble machine learning method, was used to develop a tool for targeting viral load testing to detect viraemia (>1000 copies/ml) based on clinical (CD4 count, ART regimen), viral load and demographic data, together with EAM-based adherence. Using sample-splitting (cross-validation), we evaluated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (cvAUC), potential for EAM data to selectively defer viral load tests while minimizing delays in viraemia detection, and performance compared to WHO-recommended testing schedules. RESULTS: In total, 443 persons (1801 person-years) and 485 persons (930 person-years) contributed to standard and real-time EAM analyses respectively. In the 2011 to 2015 dataset, addition of real-time EAM (cvAUC: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93) significantly improved prediction compared to clinical/demographic data alone (cvAUC: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.86; p = 0.03). In the 2005 to 2011 dataset, addition of standard EAM (cvAUC: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.81) did not significantly improve prediction compared to clinical/demographic data alone (cvAUC: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.76; p = 0.08). A hypothetical testing strategy using real-time EAM to guide deferral of viral load tests would have reduced the number of tests by 32% while detecting 87% of viraemia cases without delay. By comparison, the WHO-recommended testing schedule would have reduced the number of tests by 69%, but resulted in delayed detection of viraemia a mean of 74 days for 84% of individuals with viraemia. Similar rules derived from standard EAM also resulted in potential testing frequency reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning approach demonstrates potential for combining EAM data with other clinical measures to develop a selective testing rule that reduces number of viral load tests ordered, while still identifying those at highest risk for viraemia.'),\n",

Information on current antiretroviral therapy (ART) and anaemia is limited. The objective was to compare the associations between anaemia incidence or haemoglobin change with core ART classes in the current ART era. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: USA-based prospective clinical cohort of PLWH aged 18 and above receiving care at eight sites between January 2010 and March 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 16 505 PLWH were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anaemia risk and haemoglobin change were estimated among PLWH for person-time on a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen, relative to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based reference. We also examined PLWH on regimens containing multiple core classes. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to measure the associations between time-updated ART classes and incident anaemia or severe anaemia. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the relationships between ART classes and haemoglobin change. RESULTS: During a median of 4.9 years of follow-up, 1040 developed anaemia and 488 developed severe anaemia. Compared with NNRTI use, INSTI-based regimens were associated with an increased risk of anaemia (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58) and severe anaemia (aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.11) and a decrease in haemoglobin level. Time on multiple core classes was also associated with increased anaemia risk (aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.70), while no associations were found for PI use. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest INSTI use may increase the risk of anaemia. If confirmed, screening for anaemia development in users of INSTIs may be beneficial. Further research into the underlying mechanisms is warranted.'),\n",

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial among 60 social networks locally referred to as \"camps\" within Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Camps were randomly assigned (1:1) to a microfinance and peer health leadership intervention or a control condition that received a brief delayed intervention after the study\\'s conclusion.

Behavioral assessments were conducted at baseline and 30-months post-intervention launch, with biological samples drawn at 30-months to test for sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Primary outcomes included prevalence of STIs and past-year IPV perpetration. Secondary outcomes included STI sexual risk behaviors and past-year HIV testing. Proximal intervention targets included inequitable gender norm attitudes and hope. A modified Poisson regression approach was used to estimate intention-to-treat intervention effects on outcomes assessed at the 30-month follow-up. We enrolled 1,258 men within 60 camps. Of these men, 1,029 (81.8%) completed the 30-month follow-up. There were no differences by condition in STI prevalence, IPV perpetration, or sexual risk behaviors at the 30-month follow-up. Intervention participants reported greater levels of past-year HIV testing, controlling for baseline testing (aRR 1.13 95% CI 1.005-1.28).

After reviewing for any study duplicates the full-text of selected articles were assessed for eligibility using Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) criteria. We used fixed and random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled prevalence, pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. After a detailed assessment, a total of 14 studies containing 13,689 participants met the eligibility criteria. Among the potential risk factors: employment status, depression and sharing injecting paraphernalia had a significant relationship with HIV and drug stigma among PWIDs respectively (OR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.62-0.98), (OR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.45-2.33) and (OR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.84-1.63). Illicit drug use related stigma was found to be associated with several concurrent effects. The impact of stigma should be considered in the development of drug use prevention strategies. Perceived stigma is correlated with numerous negative consequences in other populations including people living with HIV/AIDS. These data suggest this could also be generalized to people who inject drugs because it seems that individuals with internalized stigma experience drug dependence, reduced comfort in seeking help from services and higher rates of depression.'),\n",

Understanding more about the drivers of PrEP interest could inform implementation strategies among this age group. Moreover, family dynamics may play a uniquely critical role for this younger age group, thus it is important to gauge whether caregivers would support their children's use of PrEP. We surveyed 2,089 adolescents (aged 10-16) and their caregivers in Malawi during 2017-2018. Data were collected on PrEP interest, factors that may facilitate PrEP use, and preferences for PrEP modality. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the association between the above characteristics and PrEP interest. We find that young adolescents are engaging in behaviors that would put them at substantial risk of acquiring HIV, would likely benefit from PrEP, are largely (82%) interested in using such, would prefer to get an injection over taking a daily pill, and are considerably discouraged by the prospect of side effects. Endorsement by caregivers was even greater (87%). Our findings demonstrate initial support for adolescent PrEP, and suggest parents may be a surprising advocate.\"),\n",

National level estimates could mask population-specific levels, which are critical to monitor program coverage and potential impact. Using data from the 2017 national antenatal sentinel survey, we assessed knowledge of HIV-positive status, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and socio-demographic characteristics associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy among women attending antenatal care. METHODS: Between 1 October and 15 November 2017, a nationally representative sample of 32,716 pregnant women were enrolled from 1,595 public health facilities selected from all districts of SA. Data on age, gravidity, knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART initiation prior to pregnancy were extracted from medical records. A blood sample was collected from each woman regardless of prior knowledge of HIV status or ART history, and tested for HIV in the laboratory. All HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the survey were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Multivariable survey logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy. RESULTS: Of 10,065 eligible HIV-positive women, 60.8% (95% confidence interval (CI):59.9%-61.7%) knew their HIV status prior to the current pregnancy, of whom 91.1% (95% CI: 90.4%-91.7%) initiated ART prior to the current pregnancy. Knowledge of HIV-positive status was lower among adolescent girls and young women (15-24 years) (38.9%) and primigravid women (40.5%) compared with older women (35-49 years) (75.5%) and multigravid women (64.7%). In a multivariable analysis, significant effect modification was found between gravidity and age (P value = 0.047).

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in virally-suppressed HIV+ participants measuring lymphoid tissue ART [darunavir (DRV), atazanavir (ATV), and raltegravir (RAL)] concentrations by LC-MS/MS assay. Tissue and plasma ART concentrations were used to estimate TPRs and drug-specific tissue:inhibitory concentration ratios (TICs). HIV DNA and sequentially produced HIV RNA transcripts were quantified from rectal biopsies using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays. RESULTS: Tissue samples were collected in duplicate from 19 participants: 38 rectal, 8 ileal (4 RAL, 2 DRV, 2 ATV), and 6 lymph node (4 RAL, 2 DRV) samples.

Yet, South African men face considerable HIV risk. We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing oral PrEP, injectable PrEP, or a combination of both to heterosexual South African men to assess whether providing PrEP would efficiently use resources. METHODS: Epidemiological and costing models estimated the one-year costs and outcomes associated with PrEP use in 3 scenarios. PrEP uptake was estimated for younger (aged 18-24) and older (aged 25-49) men using a discrete choice experiment. Scenarios were compared with a baseline scenario of male condom use, while a health system perspective was used to estimate discounted lifetime costs averted per HIV infection. PrEP benefit was estimated in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Uncertainty around the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: No PrEP intervention scenarios were cost-effective for both age groups at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1175/DALY averted. The lowest ICER ($2873/DALY averted) was for the provision of oral PrEP to older men, although probability of cost-effectiveness was just 0.26%. Results found that ICERs were sensitive to HIV incidence and antiretroviral coverage. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimates that providing PrEP to heterosexual South African men is not cost-effective at current cost-effectiveness thresholds. Given the ICERs' sensitivity to several variables, alongside the heterogeneity of HIV infection among South African men, PrEP may be cost-effective for older men with high incidence and other subgroups based on locality and race.

Implementation intervention and trial intervention practices achieved similar testing rates (3.764 vs. 3.081; 6% difference; 95% CI=(-5%,18%); p = 0.358), diagnosis rates (0.0035 vs. 0.0081; -13% difference; 95%CI=(-77%,244%; p = 0.837), and mean CD4 count (425 (SD=274) vs. 351 (SD=257); 69% increase; 95% CI=(-61%,249%); p = 0.359). HIV testing was positively correlated with diagnosis (r = 0.114 (95% CI=[0.074,0.163])), and diagnosis with CD4 count at diagnosis (r = 0.011 (95% CI=[-0.177,0.218])). Interpretation: Implementation of the RHIVA programme promoting nurse-led HIV screening into routine practice in inner-city practices with high HIV prevalence increased HIV testing, and may be associated with increased and earlier diagnosis. HIV screening in primary care should be considered a key strategy to reduce undiagnosed infection particularly among high risk persons not attending sexual health services.

       "  'Background: Routine HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV care appointments provide opportunities for screening men who have sex with men (MSM) for hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). However, levels of screening required for achieving the WHO elimination target of reducing HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 among all MSM are unknown. Methods: An HCV/HIV transmission model was calibrated to UK prevalence of HIV among MSM (4.7%) and chronic HCV infection among HIV-positive MSM (9.9%) and HIV-negative MSM (1.2%). Assuming 12.5% coverage of PrEP among HIV-negative MSM, we evaluated the relative reduction in overall HCV incidence by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels) of HCV screening every 12/6-months (alongside completing direct acting antiviral treatment within 6-months of diagnosis) in PrEP users and/or HIV-diagnosed MSM. We estimated the additional screening required among HIV-negative non-PrEP users to reduce overall incidence by 90% by 2030. The effect of 50% reduction in condom use among PrEP users (risk compensation) was estimated. Results: Screening and treating PrEP users for HCV every 12 or 6-months decreases HCV incidence by 67.3% (uncertainty range 52.7-79.2%) or 70.2% (57.1-80.8%), respectively, increasing to 75.4% (59.0-88.6%) or 78.8% (63.9-90.4%) if HIV-diagnosed MSM are also screened at same frequencies. Risk compensation reduces these latter projections by <10%. To reduce HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 without risk compensation, HIV-negative non-PrEP users require screening every 5.6 (3.8-9.2) years if MSM on PrEP and HIV-diagnosed MSM are screened every 6-months, shortening to 4.4 (3.1-6.6) years with risk compensation. For 25.0% PrEP coverage, the HCV elimination target can be reached without screening HIV-negative MSM not on PrEP, irrespective of risk compensation. Interpretation: At low PrEP coverage, increased screening of all MSM is required to achieve the WHO HCV-elimination targets for MSM in the UK, whereas at higher PrEP coverage this is possible through just screening HIV-diagnosed MSM and PrEP users.'),\n",

The broadly neutralizing VRC34.01 branch required the rare heavy-chain mutation Y33P to bind FP, whereas the early bifurcated VRC34.05 branch did not require this rare mutation and evolved less breadth.

METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial involving patients who had had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter for at least 6 months while taking standard oral antiretroviral therapy, we randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either continue their oral therapy or switch to monthly intramuscular injections of long-acting cabotegravir, an HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer inhibitor, and long-acting rilpivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. The primary end point was the percentage of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher at week 48, determined with the use of the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm. RESULTS: Treatment was initiated in 308 participants per group. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA levels of 50 copies per milliliter or higher were found in 5 participants (1.6%) receiving long-acting therapy and in 3 (1.0%) receiving oral therapy (adjusted difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.2 to 2.5), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for the primary end point (noninferiority margin, 6 percentage points).

Evolutionary conservation of Vpr suggests an important yet poorly understood role for macrophages in HIV pathogenesis. Vpr counteracts a previously unknown macrophage-specific restriction factor that targets and reduces the expression of HIV Env. Here, we report that the macrophage mannose receptor (MR), is a restriction factor targeting Env in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Vpr acts synergistically with HIV Nef to target distinct stages of the MR biosynthetic pathway and dramatically reduce MR expression. Silencing MR or deleting mannose residues on Env rescues Env expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages lacking Vpr. However, we also show that disrupting interactions between Env and MR reduces initial infection of macrophages by cell-free virus. Together these results reveal a Vpr-Nef-Env axis that hijacks a host mannose-MR response system to facilitate infection while evading MR's normal role, which is to trap and destroy mannose-expressing pathogens.\"),\n",

For 2013-2016, cases were linked, and two-way capture-recapture analysis was carried out.ResultsDuring 2013-2016, there were an estimated 282 (95% confidence interval (CI): 264-301) acute HCV infections among adults with HIV. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus increased the matches (from n = 107 to n = 129), and subsequently increased the estimated total: 330 (95%CI: 309-351). Under-reporting was estimated at 14-20%.ConclusionUnder-reporting of acute HCV infection among people with HIV could partially be explained by an unknown HIV-serostatus, or by differences in HCV stage (acute or chronic) at first diagnosis. Surveillance data should ideally include both acute and chronic HCV infections, and enable to distinguish these as well as initial- and re-infections.

An effective vaccine should, therefore, lead to the induction of a strong and early viral-specific CD8+ T cell response. While polyfunctional T cell responses are thought to be important contributors to the antiviral response, there is evidence to show that polyfunctional HIV- specific CD8+ T cells are just a small fraction of the total HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and may be absent in many individuals who control HIV replication, suggesting that other HIV-1 specific CD8+ effector T cell subsets may be key players in HIV control. Stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) are a subset of T cells with a long half-life and self-renewal capacity. They serve as key reservoirs for HIV and contribute a significant barrier to HIV eradication. The present study evaluated vaccine-induced antiviral responses and TSCM cells in volunteers vaccinated with a subtype C prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine candidate administered in a prime-boost regimen. We found that ADVAX DNA prime followed by MVA boost induced significantly more peripheral CD8+ TSCM cells and higher levels of CD8+ T cell-mediated inhibition of replication of different HIV-1 clades as compared to MVA alone and placebo. These findings are novel and provide encouraging evidence to demonstrate the induction of TSCM and cytotoxic immune responses by a subtype C HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine administered using a prime-boost strategy.'),\n",

We examined whether prevalent mood disorders are associated with incident NCDs and multimorbidity (accumulation of >/=2 NCDs) in PLWH. SETTING: Adult HIV clinic cohort in Nashville, Tennessee, between 1998 and 2015. METHODS: PLWH with >/=1 year of follow-up in the clinic were assessed for cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome (any 3 of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or obesity), chronic kidney and liver disease, non-AIDS-defining cancers, and dementia. Only mood disorders documented during the first year of care were included. Cumulative incidence and adjusted subhazard ratios (aSHRs) were calculated for risk of NCDs and multimorbidity with death as a competing risk. Multivariable Cox models estimated mortality risk after multimorbidity. RESULTS: Of 4140 adults, 24% had a mood disorder diagnosed in the first year of care, 51% had >/=1 NCD at baseline, and there were 2588 incident NCDs during the study period. Mood disorders were associated with increased risk of first NCD (aSHR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.57), incident multimorbidity (aSHR ranging from 1.04 to 1.42), and metabolic syndrome (aSHR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.02 to 1.64). Mood disorders were not conclusively associated with mortality risk after multimorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: PLWH with mood disorders were at increased risk of incident NCDs and multimorbidity, particularly metabolic syndrome.

While the platform is potentially cheaper and more scalable than conventional manufacturing systems, expression yields and appropriate post-translational modifications along the plant secretory pathway remain a challenge for certain proteins. Viral fusion glycoproteins in particular are often expressed at low yields in plants and, in some cases, may not be appropriately processed. Recently, however, transiently or stably engineering the host plant has shown promise as a strategy for producing heterologous proteins with more complex maturation requirements. In this study we investigated the co-expression of a suite of human chaperones to improve the production of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 soluble gp140 vaccine candidate in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The co-expression of calreticulin (CRT) resulted in a dramatic increase in Env expression and ameliorated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response - as evidenced by lower transcript abundance of representative stress-responsive genes. The co-expression of CRT similarly improved accumulation of glycoproteins from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), suggesting that the endogenous chaperone machinery may impose a bottleneck for their production. We subsequently successfully combined the co-expression of human CRT with the transient expression of human furin, to enable the production of an appropriately cleaved HIV gp140 antigen. These transient plant host engineering strategies are a promising approach for the production of high yields of appropriately processed and cleaved viral glycoproteins.'),\n",

SDG-3 has a specific target on universal health coverage (UHC), which emphasizes the importance of all people and communities having access to quality health services without risking financial hardship. The objective of this study is to review progress towards UHC using antiretroviral treatment (ART) as a case study. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods design including qualitative and quantitative approaches. We reviewed and synthesised the evidence on the evolution of the WHO HIV treatment guidelines between 2002 and 2019. We calculated ART coverage over time by gender, age group, and location. We also estimated ART coverage differences and ratios. FINDINGS: ART guidelines have evolved from \"treating the sickest\" to \"treating all\". ART coverage increased globally from under 7% in 2005 to 62% in 2018. There have been successes in increasing ART coverage in all populations and locations. However, progress varies by population and location in many regions. There is inequity in ART coverage: women (68%) versus men (55%), and adults (62%) versus children (54%). This inequity has widened over time, and with expanded ART eligibility criteria. On the other hand, data from at least one high-burden country (Ethiopia) shows that inequity among regions has narrowed over time due to the improvements in the primary health care systems and implementation of the public health approach in the country. CONCLUSION: ART coverage has increased at global, regional and national levels to all population groups. However, the gains have not been equitable among locations and populations. Policies towards universality may widen the inequity in resource-limited settings unless countries take precautions and \"put the last first\". We argue that primary health care and public health approaches, with multi-sectoral actions and community engagement, are vital to minimize inequity, achieve UHC and leave no one behind.'),\n",

Less waning of immune responses was seen after the fifth vaccination than after the fourth, with higher antibody and cellular response rates at month 18 than at month 12: IgG bAb response rates to 1086.C V1V2, 21.0% versus 9.7% (difference = 11.3%, 95% CI = 0.6%-22.0%, P = 0.039), and ZM96.C V1V2, 21.0% versus 6.5% (difference = 14.5%, 95% CI = 4.1%-24.9%, P = 0.004). IgG bAb response rates to all 4 primary V1V2 antigens were higher 2 weeks after the fifth vaccination than 2 weeks after the fourth vaccination: 87.7% versus 75.4% (difference = 12.3%, 95% CI = 1.7%-22.9%, P = 0.022) for 1086.C V1V2, 86.0% versus 63.2% (difference = 22.8%, 95% CI = 9.1%-36.5%, P = 0.001) for TV1c8.2.C V1V2, 67.7% versus 44.6% (difference = 23.1%, 95% CI = 10.4%-35.7%, P < 0.001) for ZM96.C V1V2, and 81.5% versus 60.0% (difference = 21.5%, 95% CI = 7.6%-35.5%, P = 0.002) for CaseA2_gp70_V1V2.B. IgG bAb response rates to the 3 primary vaccine-matched gp120 antigens were all above 90% at both peak timepoints, with no significant differences seen, except a higher response rate to ZM96.C gp120 at month 18 versus month 12: 64.5% versus 1.6% (difference = 62.9%, 95% CI = 49.3%-76.5%, P < 0.001). CD4+ T-cell response rates were higher at month 18 than month 12 for all 3 primary vaccine-matched antigens: 47.3% versus 29.1% (difference = 18.2%, 95% CI = 2.9%-33.4%, P = 0.021) for 1086.C, 61.8% versus 38.2% (difference = 23.6%, 95% CI = 9.5%-37.8%, P = 0.001) for TV1.C, and 63.6% versus 41.8% (difference = 21.8%, 95% CI = 5.1%-38.5%, P = 0.007) for ZM96.C, with no significant differences seen at the peak timepoints. Limitations were that higher doses of gp120 were not evaluated, this study was not designed to investigate HIV prevention efficacy, and the clinical significance of the observed immunological effects is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a 12-month booster of subtype C pox-protein vaccines restored immune responses, and slowed response decay compared to the 6-month vaccination.

       "  'INTRODUCTION: Achieving HIV epidemic control globally will require new strategies to accelerate reductions in HIV incidence and mortality. Universal test and treat (UTT) was evaluated in four randomized population-based trials (BCPP/Ya Tsie, HPTN 071/PopART, SEARCH, ANRS 12249/TasP) conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) during expanded antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility by World Health Organization guidelines and the UNAIDS 90-90-90 campaign. DISCUSSION: These three-year studies were conducted in Botswana, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and South Africa in settings with baseline HIV prevalence from 4% to 30%. Key observations across studies were: (1) Universal testing (implemented via a variety of home and community-based testing approaches) achieved >90% coverage in all studies. (2) When coupled with robust linkage to HIV care, rapid ART start and patient-centred care, UTT achieved among the highest reported population levels of viral suppression in SSA. Significant gains in population-level viral suppression were made in regions with both low and high baseline population viral load; however, viral suppression gains were not uniform across all sub-populations and were lower among youth. (3) UTT resulted in marked reductions in community HIV incidence when universal testing and robust linkage were present. However, HIV elimination targets were not reached. In BCPP and HPTN 071, annualized HIV incidence was approximately 20% to 30% lower in the intervention (which included universal testing) compared to control arms (no universal testing). In SEARCH (where both arms had universal testing), incidence declined 32% over three years. (4) UTT reduced HIV associated mortality by 23% in the intervention versus control communities in SEARCH, a study in which mortality was comprehensively measured. CONCLUSIONS: These trials provide strong evidence that UTT inclusive of universal testing increases population-level viral suppression and decreases HIV incidence and mortality faster than the status quo in SSA and should be adapted at a sub-country level as a public health strategy. However, more is needed, including integration of new prevention interventions into UTT, in order to reach UNAIDS HIV elimination targets.'),\n",

       "  \"BACKGROUND: Optimal strategies for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement in generalised HIV epidemics are unknown. We aimed to assess PrEP uptake and engagement after population-level HIV testing and universal PrEP access to characterise gaps in the PrEP cascade in rural Kenya and Uganda. METHODS: We did a 72-week interim analysis of observational data from the ongoing SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health) study. Following community sensitisation and PrEP education, we did HIV testing and offered PrEP at health fairs and facilities in 16 rural communities in western Kenya, eastern Uganda, and western Uganda. We provided enhanced PrEP counselling to individuals 15 years and older who were assessed as having an elevated HIV risk on the basis of serodifferent partnership or empirical risk score, or who otherwise self-identified as being at high risk but were not in serodifferent partnerships or identified by the risk score. PrEP follow-up visits were done at facilities, homes, or community locations. We assessed PrEP uptake within 90 days of HIV testing, programme engagement (follow-up visit attendance at week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter), refills, self-reported adherence up to 72 weeks, and concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples from individuals reporting HIV risk and adherence during follow-up, and analysed factors associated with uptake and adherence. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01864603. FINDINGS: Between June 6, 2016, and June 23, 2017, 70 379 community residents 15 years or older who had not previously been diagnosed with HIV were tested during population-level HIV testing. Of these individuals, 69 121 tested HIV-negative, 12 935 of whom had elevated HIV risk (1353 [10%] serodifferent partnership, 6938 [54%] risk score, 4644 [36%] otherwise self-identified risk). 3489 (27%) initiated PrEP, 2865 (82%) of whom did so on the same day as HIV testing and 1733 (50%) of whom were men. PrEP uptake was lower among individuals aged 15-24 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68) and mobile individuals (0.61, 0.41-0.91). At week 4, among 3466 individuals who initiated PrEP and did not withdraw or die before the first visit, 2215 (64%) were engaged in the programme, 1701 (49%) received medication refills, and 1388 (40%) self-reported adherence. At week 72, 1832 (56%) of 3274 were engaged, 1070 (33%) received a refill, and 900 (27%) self-reported adherence. Among participants reporting HIV risk at weeks 4-72, refills (89-93%) and self-reported adherence (70-76%) were high. Among sampled participants self-reporting adherence at week 24, the proportion with tenofovir concentrations in the hair reflecting at least four doses taken per week was 66%, and reflecting seven doses per week was 44%. Participants who stopped PrEP accepted HIV testing at 4274 (83%) of 5140 subsequent visits; half of these participants later restarted PrEP. 29 participants of 3489 who initiated PrEP had serious adverse events, including seven deaths. Five adverse events (all grade 3) were assessed as being possibly related to the study drug. INTERPRETATION: During population-level HIV testing, inclusive risk assessment (combining serodifferent partnership, an empirical risk score, and self-identification of HIV risk) was feasible and identified individuals who could benefit from PrEP. The biggest gap in the PrEP cascade was PrEP uptake, particularly for young and mobile individuals. Participants who initiated PrEP and had perceived HIV risk during follow-up reported taking PrEP, but one-third had drug concentrations consistent with poor adherence, highlighting the need for novel approaches and long-acting formulations as PrEP roll-out expands.

Previous statistical simulations indicate these trials may be partially protective. In that case, it will be crucial to identify the mechanism of breakthrough infections. To that end, we developed a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the AMP trials and infer the breakthrough mechanisms using measurable trial outcomes. This framework combines viral dynamics with antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and will be generally applicable to forthcoming bNAb prevention trials. We fit our model to human viral load data (RV217). Then, we incorporated VRC01 neutralization using serum pharmacokinetics (HVTN 104) and in vitro pharmacodynamics (LANL CATNAP database). We systematically explored trial outcomes by reducing in vivo potency and varying the distribution of sensitivity to VRC01 in circulating strains. We found trial outcomes could be used in a clinical trial regression model (CTRM) to reveal whether partially protective trials were caused by large fractions of VRC01-resistant (IC50>50 mug/mL) circulating strains or rather a global reduction in VRC01 potency against all strains. The former mechanism suggests the need to enhance neutralizing antibody breadth; the latter suggests the need to enhance VRC01 delivery and/or in vivo binding. We will apply the clinical trial regression model to data from the completed trials to help optimize future approaches for passive delivery of anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies.'),\n",

Limited studies have looked at the association of markers of monocyte activation with HAND in Africa. We examined this association among HIV-1-infected patients in Nigeria. METHOD: A total of 190 HIV-infected treatment-naive participants with immune marker data were included in this cross-sectional study. Plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and neopterin were measured. Demographically adjusted T scores obtained from a 7-domain neuropsychological test battery were generated, and functional status was assessed using activities of daily living questionnaire. Participants were classified as unimpaired, having asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in line with the \"Frascati\" criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-two participants (16.8%) had ANI, 14 (7.4%) had MND, whereas none had HAD. In multivariable linear regression analyses, after adjusting for age, gender, education, CD4 count, and viral load, mean levels of sCD14 were higher among those with ANI and MND as compared with the unimpaired (P = 0.033 and 0.023, respectively). Similarly, the mean level of MCP-1 was greater among those with HAND as compared with the unimpaired (P = 0.047). There were also trends for higher levels of sCD163 and TNF-alpha among females with MND in univariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of monocyte activation markers correlate with the severity of impairment among individuals with HAND. The mechanisms that underlie these effects and the potential role of gender require further study.'),\n",

We previously reported the amino-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP8) - when conjugated to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) - to be capable of inducing broadly neutralizing responses against HIV-1 in animal models. However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice. Overall, SIAB-linked FP8-rTTHC appears to be a promising vaccine candidate for advancing to clinical assessment.'),\n",

In this study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of shorter, simpler regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV expressing mosaic HIV-1 Env/Gag/Pol antigens combined with aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial (IPCAVD010/HPX1002) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. We included healthy, HIV-uninfected participants (aged 18-50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV infection and had not received any vaccines in the 14 days before study commencement. We randomly assigned participants via a computer-generated randomisation schedule and interactive web response system to one of three study groups (1:1:1) testing different regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 x 10(10) viral particles per 0.5 mL) combined with 250 mug adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. They were then assigned to treatment or placebo subgroups (5:1) within each of the three main groups. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation until the end of the follow-up period. Group 1 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at weeks 0 and 12 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 24 and 48. Group 2 received Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Group 3 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at week 0 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 8 and 24. Participants in the control group received 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. The primary endpoints were Env-specific binding antibody responses at weeks 28, 52, and 72 and safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens for 28 days after the injection. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose or placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. The IPCAVD010/HPX1002 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02685020. We also did a parallel preclinical study in rhesus monkeys to test the protective efficacy of the shortened group 3 regimen. FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2016, and Aug 19, 2016, we randomly assigned 36 participants to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo, ten to each vaccine group and two to the corresponding placebo group. 30 (83%) participants completed the full study, and six (17%) discontinued it prematurely because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, and an unrelated death from a motor vehicle accident. The two shortened regimens elicited comparable antibody titres against autologous clade C Env at peak immunity to the longer, 12-month regimen: geometric mean titre (GMT) 41 007 (95% CI 17 959-93 636) for group 2 and 49 243 (29 346-82 630) for group 3 at week 28 compared with 44 590 (19 345-102 781) for group 1 at week 52). Antibody responses remained increased (GMT >5000) in groups 2 and 3 at week 52 but were highest in group 1 at week 72. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, Env-specific IgG3, tier 1A neutralising activity, and broad cellular immune responses were detected in all groups. All vaccine regimens were well tolerated. Mild-to-moderate pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most commonly reported solicited local adverse event, reported by 28 vaccine recipients (93%) and two placebo recipients (33%). Grade 3 solicited systemic adverse events were reported by eight (27%) vaccine recipients and no placebo recipients; the most commonly reported grade 3 systemic symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, and chills. The shortened group 3 regimen induced comparable peak immune responses in 30 rhesus monkeys as in humans and resulted in an 83% (95% CI 38.7-95, p=0.004 log-rank test) reduction in per-exposure acquisition risk after six intrarectal challenges with SHIV-SF162P3 at week 54, more than 6 months after final vaccination. INTERPRETATION: Short, 6-month regimens of a mosaic HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine elicited robust HIV-specific immune responses that were similar to responses elicited by a longer, 12-month schedule. Preclinical data showed partial protective efficacy of one of the short vaccine regimens in rhesus monkeys. Further clinical studies are required to test the suitability of the shortened vaccine regimens in humans. Such shortened regimens would be valuable to increase vaccine delivery at the community level, particularly in resource-limited settings.

There is an urgent need for evidence-based, cost-effective, and scalable interventions to improve maternal adherence and retention that can be feasibly implemented in overburdened health systems. Brief video-based interventions are a promising but underutilized approach to this crisis. We describe a trial protocol to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a standardized educational video-based intervention targeting HIV-infected pregnant women that seeks to optimize their ART retention and adherence by providing a VITAL Start (Video intervention to Inspire Treatment Adherence for Life) before committing to lifelong ART. METHODS: This study is a multisite parallel group, randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of a brief facility-based video intervention to optimize retention and adherence to ART among pregnant women living with HIV in Malawi. A total of 892 pregnant women living with HIV and not yet on ART will be randomized to standard-of-care pre-ART counseling or VITAL Start. The primary outcome is a composite of retention and adherence (viral load < 1000 copies/ml) 12 months after starting ART. Secondary outcomes include assessments of behavioral adherence (self-reported adherence, pharmacy refill, and tenofovir diphosphate concentration), psychosocial impact, and resource utilization. We will also examine the implementation of VITAL Start via surveys and qualitative interviews with patients, partners, and health care workers and conduct cost-effectiveness analyses. DISCUSSION: This is a robust evaluation of an innovative facility-based video intervention for pregnant women living with HIV, with the potential to improve maternal and infant outcomes.

The primary study endpoint was based on the results of laboratory-based HIV testing for> 48,000 participants who were followed for up to three years. This report evaluated the performance of HIV assays and algorithms used to determine HIV status and identify incident HIV infections in HPTN 071, and assessed the impact of errors on HIV incidence estimates. METHODS: HIV status was determined using a streamlined, algorithmic approach. A single HIV screening test was performed at centralized laboratories in Zambia and South Africa (all participants, all visits). Additional testing was performed at the HPTN Laboratory Center using antigen/antibody screening tests, a discriminatory test and an HIV RNA test. This testing was performed to investigate cases with discordant test results and confirm incident HIV infections. RESULTS: HIV testing identified 978 seroconverter cases. This included 28 cases where the participant had acute HIV infection at the first HIV-positive visit. Investigations of cases with discordant test results identified cases where there was a participant or sample error (mixups). Seroreverter cases (errors where status changed from HIV infected to HIV uninfected, 0.4% of all cases) were excluded from the primary endpoint analysis. Statistical analysis demonstrated that exclusion of those cases improved the accuracy of HIV incidence estimates. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that the streamlined, algorithmic approach effectively identified HIV infections in this large cluster-randomized trial. Longitudinal HIV testing (all participants, all visits) and quality control testing provided useful data on the frequency of errors and provided more accurate data for HIV incidence estimates.'),\n",

METHODS: Children were enrolled (6-12 weeks of age), and vaccinated with a three-dose primary series of 7-valent PCV (PCV7) and HibCV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Study groups included infants infected with HIV perinatally with CD4+ >/= 25% initiating ART following immunological or clinical deterioration (ART-Def), or immediately upon enrolment followed by interruption at 40 (ART-Immed/40w) or 96 weeks (ART-Immed/96w); and HIV-uninfected infants with (HEU), and without HIV (HIV-unexpsoed) exposure in utero. Within each group, children were randomized to receive either a booster dose of PCV7 or HibCV at 15 months of age. PCV serotype-specific and polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) IgG were measured pre-boost, two-weeks post-boost and at two-years of age. Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) to serotypes 9V, 19F and 23F was measured post-booster dose. RESULTS: Persistence of IgG to PCV vaccine-serotypes and anti-PRP was similar in all groups of children living with HIV (CLWH) compared to HIV-unexposed children. Anamnestic responses to PCV and HibCV were also similar in all three groups of CLWH compared to HIV-unexposed children. CLWH, however, tended to have lower functional antibody (OPA) titers than HIV-unexposed children after the PCV booster dose for some serotypes. Immunity to PCV and HibCV was similar between the ART-Immed/40w and ART-Immed-96w groups. There were no differences in IgG kinetics between HEU and HIV-unexposed children. CONCLUSIONS: A three dose primary series, with or without PCV or HibCV booster doses in CLWH initiated on ART during infancy, would likely be similarly effective in preventing invasive bacterial disease as in HIV-unexposed children.'),\n",

(2) Motivations, benefits, and consequences of responding. Participants experienced self and altruistic driven motivations. Benefits included increased self-worth, economic resources, and leverage for better healthcare treatment, and reduced internalized stigma and isolation. Negative consequences included defensive provider reactions, being further stereotyped, and decreased physical and mental health. (3) Recommendations for systemic change.

We assayed >60 modulators of RNA alternative splicing (AS) to identify new inhibitors of HIV-1 RNA processing-a segment of the viral lifecycle not targeted by current drugs-and discovered compound N-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-amine (5342191) as a potent inhibitor of both wild-type (Ba-L, NL4-3, LAI, IIIB, and N54) and drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 (IC50: ~700 nM) with no significant effect on cell viability at doses tested. 5342191 blocks expression of four essential HIV-1 structural and regulatory proteins (Gag, Env, Tat, and Rev) without affecting total protein synthesis of the cell. This response is associated with altered unspliced (US) and singly-spliced (SS) HIV-1 RNA accumulation (~60% reduction) and transport to the cytoplasm (loss of Rev) whereas parallel analysis of cellular RNAs revealed less than a 0.7% of host alternative splicing (AS) events (0.25-0.67% by >/= 10-20%), gene expression (0.01-0.46% by >/= 2-5 fold), and protein abundance (0.02-0.34% by >/= 1.5-2 fold) being affected. Decreased expression of Tat, but not Gag/Env, upon 5342191 treatment was reversed by a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that this compound alters the synthesis/degradation of this key viral factor. Consistent with an affect on HIV-1 RNA processing, 5342191 treatment of cells altered the abundance and phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) 1, 3, and 4. Despite the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways by 5342191 (Ras, MEK1/2-ERK1/2, and JNK1/2/3), inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression by this compound could be reversed by pre-treatment with either a G-protein alpha-subunit inhibitor or two different MEK1/2 inhibitors. These observations demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of HIV-1 gene expression to small changes in host RNA processing and highlights the potential of modulating host intracellular signaling as an alternative approach for controlling HIV-1 infection.'),\n",

In two independent cohorts, we found that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) were depleted in the blood and gut of people with HIV-1, even with effective antiretroviral therapy. ILC depletion was associated with neutrophil infiltration of the gut lamina propria, type 1 interferon activation, increased microbial translocation and natural killer (NK) cell skewing towards an inflammatory state, with chromatin structure and phenotype typical of WNT transcription factor TCF7-dependent memory T cells. Cytokines that are elevated during acute HIV-1 infection reproduced the ILC and NK cell abnormalities ex vivo.

However, barriers to ART access may delay initiation in resource-limited settings. We characterized temporal trends and other factors influencing the interval between HIV diagnosis and ART initiation among participants enrolled in a clinic-based cohort across four African countries. METHODS: The African Cohort Study enrols adults engaged in care at 12 sites in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. Participants provide a medical history, complete a physical examination and undergo laboratory assessments every six months. Participants with recorded dates of HIV diagnosis were categorized by WHO guideline era (<2006, 2006 to 2009, 2010 to 2012, 2013 to 2015, >/=2016) at the time of diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for time to ART initiation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From January 2013 to September 2019, a total of 2888 adults living with HIV enrolled with known diagnosis dates. Median time to ART initiation decreased from 22.0 months (interquartile range (IQR) 4.0 to 77.3) among participants diagnosed prior to 2006 to 0.5 months (IQR 0.2 to 1.8) among those diagnosed in 2016 and later. Comparing those same periods, CD4 nadir increased from a median of 166 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 81 to 286) to 298 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 151 to 501). In the final adjusted model, participants diagnosed in each subsequent WHO guideline era had increased rates of ART initiation compared to those diagnosed before 2006. CD4 nadir >/=500 cells/mm(3) was independently associated with a lower rate of ART initiation as compared to CD4 nadir <200 cells/mm(3) (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.37). Age >50 years at diagnosis was independently associated with shorter time to ART initiation as compared to 18 to 29 years (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with changing guidelines, the interval between diagnosis and ART initiation has decreased over time. Still, many adults living with HIV initiated treatment with low CD4, highlighting the need to diagnose HIV earlier while improving access to immediate ART after diagnosis.'),\n",

Methods: Treatment effects of edoxaban (30 mg), a direct factor Xa inhibitor, vs placebo were investigated in a randomized, double-blind crossover trial among participants with HIV and viral suppression and D-dimer levels >/=100 ng/mL. During each 4-month crossover period, blood measures of coagulation, inflammation, and immune activation were assessed. Analyses of change on edoxaban vs change on placebo used linear mixed models. Results: Forty-four participants were randomized, and 40 completed at least 1 visit during each study period. The mean age was 49 years, and the CD4+ count was 739 cells/mm(3). Edoxaban treatment led to declines in D-dimer (44%) and thrombin-antithrombin complex (26%) but did not lower inflammatory or immune activation measures. More bruising or bleeding events occurred during edoxaban (n = 28) than during placebo or no drug periods (n = 15).

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been shown to be effective in addressing these gaps. In Washington, District of Columbia (DC), we conducted a randomized trial of an SMS text messaging-based mHealth intervention (CARE+ Corrections) to increase linkage to community HIV care and antiretroviral treatment adherence among HIV-infected persons involved in the criminal justice system. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the SMS text messaging-based intervention, participant use of the intervention, and barriers and facilitators of implementation. METHODS: From August 2013 to April 2015, HIV-positive incarcerated individuals were recruited within the DC Department of Corrections, and persons released in the past 6 months were recruited within the community via street-based recruitment, community partnerships, and referrals. Participants were followed for 6 months and received weekly or daily SMS text messages. Formative research resulted in the development of the content of the messages in 4 categories: HIV Appointment Reminders, Medication Adherence, Prevention Reminders, and Barriers to Care following release from jail. Participants could customize the timing, frequency, and message content throughout the study period. RESULTS: Of the 112 participants enrolled, 57 (50.9%) were randomized to the intervention group and 55 (49.1%) to the control group; 2 control participants did not complete the baseline visit, and were dropped from the study, leaving a total of 110 participants who contributed to the analyses. Study retention was similar across both study arms. Median age was 42 years (IQR 30-50), 86% (49/57) were black or African American, 58% (33/57) were male, 25% (14/57) were female, and 18% (10/57) were transgender. Median length of last incarceration was 4 months (IQR 1.7-9.0), and median lifetime number of times incarcerated was 6.5 (IQR 3.5-14.0). Most participants (32/54, 59%) had a baseline viral load of <200 copies/mL. Nearly all participants (52/57, 91%) chose to use a cell phone provided by the study. The most preferred Appointment Reminder message was Hey how you feeling? Don't forget to give a call and make your appointment (19/57, 33%). The most preferred Medication Adherence message was Don't forget your skittles! (31/57, 54%), and 63% (36/57) of participants chose to receive daily (vs weekly) messages from this category at baseline. The most preferred Prevention Reminder message was Stay strong. Stay clean (18/57, 32%). The most preferred Barriers to Care message was Holla at your case manager, they're here to help (12/57, 22%). Minor message preference differences were observed among participants enrolled in the jail versus those from the community. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' ability to customize their SMS text message plan proved helpful. Further large-scale research on mHealth platforms is needed to assess its efficacy among HIV-infected persons with a history of incarceration.

Fifty-one percent of participants were classified as lonely. The prevalence of loneliness was lower in the older age group, 46.2% vs. 53.8% (Chi (2) = 5.53, p = 0.02). Covariates associated with loneliness included being younger, being single, having at least a four-year college degree, living alone, screening positive for depression, using recreational drugs, smoking tobacco, having a lower quality of life, and not feeling close to friends. Logistic regression analysis showed that the \"younger old\" were at 26% greater risk of loneliness, after controlling for the effects of these covariates (RR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06-1.45).

DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional biobehavioural survey of people who had not been previously diagnosed with HIV found in venues. METHODS: We identified participants who would have been tested for HIV under each of 10 hypothetical outreach testing strategies and calculated the proportion who would have newly tested positive for HIV under each strategy. On the basis of this proportion, we calculated the 'number needed to test' (NNT) to identify one new case of HIV under each strategy. All estimates were obtained by applying survey sampling weights to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: If testing was performed at a random sample of venues, 35 people would need to be tested to identify one new case of HIV, but higher yield could be found by limiting testing to venues with specific characteristics. Strategies focusing on women had higher testing yield. Testing women employed by venues would result in highest yield of all strategies examined (NNT = 15), while testing men under age 24 would result in the lowest yield (NNT = 99). CONCLUSION: Quantitatively evaluating HIV testing strategies prior to implementation using survey data presents a new opportunity to refine and prioritize outreach testing strategies for the people and places most likely to result in high HIV testing yield.\"),\n",

As a result, self-reported condom use among high-risk populations is thought to be systematically over-reported, and it is impossible to identify the determinants of condom use. The main objective of the article is to elicit unbiased information on condom use among female sex workers (FSWs) using the double list experiment method to analyse the role of HIV infection and exposure to HIV prevention methods in condom use. More specifically, the difference in levels of condom use between HIV-positive and HIV-negative FSWs is estimated. In addition, the role of FSWs' registration and participation in a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) demonstration project in condom use is considered. A list experiment was designed to elicit condom use information from 786 FSWs in Senegal who were surveyed in 2015 and 2017. Using the list experiment method, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (treatment or control) and were asked to report the number of statements they agreed with. Respondents assigned to the control group were presented with three non-sensitive items, whereas those allocated to the treatment group were presented with the same three statements plus the sensitive item (e.g. 'I used a condom during my last intercourse with a client'). Comparing the average number of sentences that were agreed with in both groups provides an estimation of the condom use rate in the treatment group and estimating such prevalence for several sub-groups allows the role of HIV infection risk in condom use to be identified. The percentage of FSWs using condoms in their last sexual intercourse with a client was 80% in 2015 and 78% in 2017, which was significantly lower than the 97% obtained in the face-to-face surveys in both waves. When estimating condom use among sub-groups with the list experiment method, we found that condom use among HIV-positive FSWs was only 34%, which was 47 percentage points lower than condom use among HIV-negative FSWs. We also found that registered FSWs are more likely to use condoms than clandestine FSWs. However, we did not find any difference in condom use between FSWs who were enrolled in the PrEP demonstration project and those who were not enrolled. Health policies should therefore aim to increase condom use among HIV-positive FSWs.\"),\n",

Recent work has focused on elucidating the role of cognitive factors in pain-smoking interrelations, and PLWH have endorsed various beliefs regarding pain and smoking. There is reason to suspect that pain self-efficacy (i.e., belief in one's ability to cope with pain) may be associated with the maintenance of smoking. However, no previous research has examined relations between pain self-efficacy and motivation to quit. The goal of this study was to conduct the first test of cross-sectional associations between pain self-efficacy and motivation to quit smoking among PLWH. Race was tested as a moderator of the hypothesized associations. Participants (N = 76 daily smokers; 37% female; Mage = 50.6; MCPD = 13.7) were recruited from an outpatient infectious disease clinic for a primary study examining the effects of a personalized feedback intervention for PLWH. Results indicated that pain self-efficacy was positively associated with perceived importance of quitting and intention to quit within the next six months across the entire sample (ps < 0.05), and positively associated with readiness to consider smoking cessation and confidence in quitting among Black/African American participants (but not among other participants; ps < 0.05).

       "  'BACKGROUND: The RV144 phase 3 vaccine trial in Thailand demonstrated that ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) and AIDSVAX B/E administration over 6 months resulted in a 31% efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition. In this trial, we assessed the immunological effect of an additional vaccine boost to the RV144 regimen at varying intervals between the priming vaccine series and the boost. METHODS: RV306 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial done at three clinical sites in Thailand. Eligible volunteers were HIV-uninfected individuals aged 20-40 years who were at low risk for HIV infection and in good health. A randomisation schedule was centrally generated with fixed sized strata for Research Institute for Health Sciences Chiang Mai and combined Bangkok clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five groups and then further randomly assigned to either vaccine or placebo. All participants received the primary RV144 vaccine series at months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Group 1 received no additional boost, group 2 received additional AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) or placebo at month 12, group 3 received AIDSVAX B/E alone or placebo at month 12, group 4a received AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV or placebo at month 15, and group 4b received AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC-HIV or placebo at month 18. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of these vaccination regimens and cellular and humoral immune responses compared between the RV144 series alone and regimens with late boosts at different timepoints. Safety and tolerability outcomes were assessed by evaluating local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events in all participants. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01931358); clinical follow-up is now complete. FINDINGS: Between Oct 28, 2013, and April 29, 2014, 367 participants were enrolled, of whom 27 were assigned active vaccination in group 1, 102 in group 2, 101 in group 3, 52 in group 4a, 51 in group 4b, and 34 combined placebo across all the groups. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. Occurrence and severity of local and systemic reactogenicity were similar across active groups. Groups with late boosts (groups 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) had increased peak plasma IgG-binding antibody levels against gp70 V1V2 relative to group 1 vaccine recipients with no late boost (gp70 V1V2 92TH023 adjusted p<0.02 for each; gp70 V1V2 CaseA2 adjusted p<0.0001 for each). Boosting at month 12 (groups 2 and 3) did not increase gp120 responses compared with the peak responses after the RV144 priming regimen at month 6; however, boosting at month 15 (group 4a) improved responses to gp120 A244gD- D11 (p=0.0003), and boosting at month 18 (group 4b) improved responses to both gp120 A244gD- D11 (p<0.0001) and gp120 MNgD- D11 (p=0.0016). Plasma IgG responses were significantly lower among vaccine recipients boosted at month 12 (pooled groups 2 + 3) than at month 15 (group 4a; adjusted p<0.0001 for each, except for gp70 V1V2 CaseA2, p=0.0142) and at month 18 (group 4b; all adjusted p<0.001). Boosting at month 18 versus month 15 resulted in a significantly higher plasma IgG response to gp120 antigens (all adjusted p<0.01) but not gp70 V1V2 antigens. CD4 functionality and polyfunctionality scores after stimulation with HIV-1 Env peptides (92TH023) increased with delayed boosting. Groups with late boosts had increased functionality and polyfunctionality scores relative to vaccine recipients with no late boost (all adjusted p<0.05, except for the polyfunctionality score in group 1 vs group 4b, p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results suggest that additional boosting of the RV144 regimen with longer intervals between the primary vaccination series and late boost improved immune responses and might improve the efficacy of preventing HIV acquisition.

We investigated circulating antibody specificities in two phase 1 poxvirus prime-protein boost clinical trials conducted in South Africa: HVTN 097 (subtype B/E) and HVTN 100 (subtype C). With cross-subtype peptide microarrays and multiplex binding assays, we probed the magnitude and breadth of circulating antibody responses to linear variable loop 2 (V2) and conformational V1V2 specificities. Antibodies targeting the linear V2 epitope, a correlate of decreased HIV-1 risk in RV144, were elicited up to 100% and 61% in HVTN 097 and HVTN 100, respectively. Despite higher magnitude of envelope-specific responses in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097 (p's < 0.001), the magnitude and positivity for V2 linear epitope and V1V2 proteins were significantly lower in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097. Meanwhile, responses to other major linear epitopes including the variable 3 (V3) and constant 5 (C5) epitopes were higher in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097. Our data reveal substantial differences in the circulating antibody specificities induced by vaccination in these two canarypox prime-protein boost trials. Our findings suggest that the choice of viral sequences in prime-boost vaccine regimens, and potentially adjuvants and immunogen dose, influence the elicitation of V2-specific antibodies.\"),\n",

In 2016/17, a pre- and post-test comparison group design was used to implement a syndemic theory-based intervention among 459 MSM (229, intervention; 230, standard-of-care comparison) recruited through non-governmental organizations in Chandigarh, India. The intervention group received two-session peer-delivered motivational interviewing-based HIV risk reduction counselling and skills training to improve sexual communication/negotiation and condom use self-efficacy, and screening/management of psychosocial health problems. The intervention's effect on consistent condom use was estimated using difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Mediation analysis assessed the extent to which intervention effects on the outcome were mediated by changes in psychosocial health problems and condom use self-efficacy. A process evaluation assessed implementation fidelity and intervention acceptability. Baseline consistent condom use was 43% in the intervention group and 46% in the standard-of-care group. Baseline survey findings demonstrated that a psychosocial syndemic of problematic alcohol use, internalised homonegativity and violence victimisation synergistically increased condomless anal intercourse. Using DiD, we estimated that the intervention increased consistent condom use with male partners by 16.4% (95% CI: 7.1, 25.7) and with female partners by 28.2% (95% CI: 11.9, 44.4), and decreased problematic alcohol use by 24.3% (95%CI: -33.4, -15.3), depression by 20.0% (95% CI: -27.6, -12.3) and internalised homonegativity by 34.7% (95% CI: -43.6%, -25.8%). The mediation analysis findings suggested that the intervention might have improved consistent condom use by decreasing internalised homonegativity and by increasing condom use self-efficacy. The process evaluation showed high levels of acceptability/satisfaction among participants and high levels of implementation fidelity. A syndemic theory-based intervention tailored for MSM in India is feasible, acceptable, and can reduce HIV transmission risk behaviour as well as problematic alcohol use, depression and internalised homonegativity.\"),\n",

We aimed to determine the relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort (n = 52) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Bacterial alpha-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS(+)) bacteria previously linked to inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe periodontitis. Fungal alpha-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and plaque from patients with a history of AIDS. Our results show that both bacterial and fungal oral microbiome communities likely play a role in chronic systemic immune activation in PLWH. Thus, interventions targeting both inflammation and the microbiome, particularly in the oral cavity, may be necessary to reduce chronic immune dysregulation in patients with HIV.IMPORTANCE A feedback loop between dysbiotic gut microbiota, increased translocation of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide, and inflammation has been hypothesized to cause immune system dysfunction in early HIV infection. However, despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients. More broadly, these findings can bolster general models of microbiome-mediated chronic systemic immune activation and aid the development of precise microbiota-targeted interventions to reverse chronic inflammation.'),\n",

These approaches show promise for achieving control of the HIV epidemic. At the same time, United Nations Member States have committed to achieving broader health and development goals by 2030, including universal health coverage (UHC). HIV epidemic control will facilitate UHC by averting the need to commit ever-increasing resources to HIV services. Yet an overly targeted HIV response could also distort health systems, impede integration and potentially threaten broader health goals. We discuss current approaches to achieving both UHC and HIV epidemic control, noting potential areas of friction between disease-specific microtargeting and integrated health systems, and highlighting opportunities for convergence that could enhance both initiatives. Examples of these programmatic elements that could be better aligned include: improved information systems with unique identifiers to track and monitor individuals across health services and the life course; strengthened subnational data use; more accountable supply chains that supply a broad range of services; and strengthened community-based services and workforces. We argue that the response both to HIV and to broader health threats should use these areas of convergence to increase health systems efficiency and mitigate the harm of any potential decrease in health funding. Further investments in implementation and monitoring of these programme elements will be needed to make progress towards both UHC and HIV epidemic control.'),\n",

HIV transmission links, especially those involving persons with acute HIV infection (AHI), can be difficult to uncover, or confirm during partner services investigations. We integrated molecular, epidemiologic, serologic and behavioral data to infer and evaluate transmission linkages between participants of a prospective study of AHI conducted in North Carolina, New York City and San Francisco from 2011-2013. Among the 547 participants with newly diagnosed HIV with polymerase sequences, 465 sex partners were reported, of whom only 35 (7.5%) had HIV sequences. Among these 35 contacts, 23 (65.7%) links were genetically supported and 12 (34.3%) were not. Only five links were reported between participants with AHI but none were genetically supported. In contrast, phylodynamic inference identified 102 unreported transmission links, including 12 between persons with AHI. Importantly, all putative transmission links between persons with AHI were found among large clusters with more than five members. Taken together, the presence of putative links between acute participants who did not name each other as contacts that are found only among large clusters underscores the potential for unobserved or undiagnosed intermediaries. Phylodynamics identified many more links than partner services alone and, if routinely and rapidly integrated, can illuminate transmission patterns not readily captured by partner services investigations.'),\n",

Method The WIN test and cognitive function were assessed in participants of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol Up. Impaired WIN (IWIN) performance was defined as a signal-to-babble ratio of > +10 dB. Cognitive function was determined based on fluid cognition composite scores (FCCSs) and crystallized cognition composite scores, and < 70 was considered a fluid or crystallized cognitive impairment. Log binomial models were used to calculate the relative risks of IWIN between PHIV and PHEU. Results PHIV (n = 334) and PHEU (n = 52) participants had similar WIN thresholds and IWIN percentages. For young adults with FCCS >/= 70, participants with PHIV were less likely to have IWIN for the better ear and worse ear as compared to participants with PHEU. For young adults with FCCS < 70, there was no association between HIV status and risk of IWIN for the better ear or worse ear. For those adults with crystallized cognition composite score of >/= 70, young adults with PHIV were less likely to have IWIN for the better ear than young adults with PHEU; there was no association between HIV status and IWIN for the worse ear. For young adults with PHIV without a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Class C diagnosis, a longer combination ART duration was associated with a higher risk of IWIN for the better ear.

This led us to compare CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts and CD4+/CD8+ ratios between HIV-negative MSM and men who only have sex with women (MSW) and relate observed differences in behavioral factors and infectious exposures, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. METHODS: In 368 HIV-negative MSM and 72 HIV-negative MSW, T lymphocyte phenotyping was performed 3 times biennially. Baseline CMV serology and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence and/or STI seroprevalence, sexual, and substance-use behavior data were collected during study visits. RESULTS: Men who have sex with men, compared with MSW, had higher CD8+ counts (551 vs 437 cells/mm3, P < .001), similar CD4+ counts (864 vs 880 cells/mm3, P = .5), and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratios (1.84 vs 2.47, P < .001). Differences were most pronounced for MSM with >10 recent sex partners and partly explained by higher CMV seroprevalence in MSM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that factors other than HIV may, in both PWH and certain HIV-negative MSM, contribute to a low CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Whether this, like in PWH, contributes to comorbidity risk in HIV-negative MSM requires further study.'),\n",

Latently infected cells form a persistent, heterogeneous reservoir that at any time can reactivate the integrated HIV-1. Here we confirmed that latently infected cells from HIV-1 positive study participants exhibited active HIV-1 transcription but without production of mature spliced mRNAs. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this we employed primary HIV-1 latency models to study latency establishment and maintenance. We characterized proviral transcription and chromatin development in cultures of resting primary CD4+ T-cells for four months after ex vivo HIV-1 infection. As heterochromatin (marked with H3K9me3 or H3K27me3) gradually stabilized, the provirus became less accessible with reduced activation potential. In a subset of infected cells, active marks (e.g. H3K27ac) and elongating RNAPII remained detectable at the latent provirus, despite prolonged proviral silencing. In many aspects, latent HIV-1 resembled an active enhancer in a subset of resting cells. The enhancer chromatin actively promoted latency and the enhancer-specific CBP/P300-inhibitor GNE049 was identified as a new latency reversal agent. The division of the latent reservoir according to distinct chromatin compositions with different reactivation potential enforces the notion that even though a relatively large set of cells contains the HIV-1 provirus, only a discrete subset is readily able to reactivate the provirus and spread the infection.'),\n",

Both regimens utilized a recombinant canarypox vector (ALVAC-HIV) prime and a bivalent recombinant HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein 120 subunit boost. We hypothesized that within each trial, there were participant subgroups sharing similar immune responses and that their frequencies differed across trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from three trials-RV144 (NCT00223080), HVTN 097 (NCT02109354), and HVTN 100 (NCT02404311), the latter of which was pivotal in advancing the tested pox-protein HIV vaccine regimen to the HVTN 702 Phase 2b/3 efficacy trial. We found that bivariate CD4+ T-cell and anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 antibody response patterns were similar by age, sex-at-birth, and body mass index, but differed for the pox-protein clade AE/B alum-adjuvanted regimen studied in RV144 and HVTN 097 (PAE/B/alum) compared to the pox-protein clade C/C MF59-adjuvanted regimen studied in HVTN 100 (PC/MF59). Specifically, more PAE/B/alum recipients had low CD4+ T-cell and high anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 responses, and more PC/MF59 recipients had broad responses of both types. Analyses limited to \"vaccine-matched\" antigens suggested that some of the differences in responses between the regimens could have been due to antigens in the assays that did not match the vaccine immunogens. Our approach was also useful in identifying subgroups with unusually absent or high co-responses across assay types, flagging individuals for further characterization by functional assays. We also found that co-responses of anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 and CD4+ T cells had broad variability. As additional immune response assays are standardized and validated, we anticipate our framework will be increasingly valuable for multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach can be used to advance vaccine development objectives, including the characterization and comparison of candidate vaccine multivariate immune responses and improved design of studies to identify correlates of protection. For instance, results suggested that HVTN 702 will have adequate power to interrogate immune correlates involving anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 and CD4+ T-cell co-readouts, but will have lower power to study anti-gp120/gp140 IgG/IgG3 due to their lower dynamic ranges. The findings also generate hypotheses for future testing in experimental and computational analyses aimed at achieving a mechanistic understanding of vaccine-elicited immune response heterogeneity.'),\n",

Here, we measured HIV-specific antibody responses in 14 South African volunteers who acquired HIV infection after participating in phase 1/2 trials of envelope-containing immunogens. Serum samples were collected annually following HIV-1 infection from participants in trials HVTN 073 (subtype C, DNA/MVA, phase 1 trial, n = 1), HVTN 086 (subtype C, DNA/MVA/gp140 protein, phase 1 trial, n = 2), and HVTN 204 (multisubtype, DNA/adenovirus serotype 5 [Ad5], phase 2 trial, n = 7) and 4 placebo recipients. Binding and neutralizing antibody responses to Env proteins and peptides were determined pre- and post-HIV infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the TZM-bl cell neutralization assay, respectively. HIV-infected South African individuals served as unvaccinated controls. Binding antibodies to gp41, V3, V2, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the CD4 binding site were detected from the first year of HIV-1 subtype C infection, and the levels were similar in vaccinated and placebo recipients. Neutralizing antibody responses against tier 1A viruses were detected in all participants, with the highest titers being to a subtype C virus, MW965.26. No responses were observed just prior to infection, indicating that vaccine-primed HIV-specific antibodies had waned. Sporadic neutralization activity against tier 2 isolates was observed after 2 to 3 years of HIV infection, but these responses were similar in the vaccinated and placebo groups as well as the unvaccinated controls. Our data suggest that prior vaccination with these immunogens did not alter the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection, nor did it accelerate the development of HIV neutralization breadth.IMPORTANCE There is a wealth of information on HIV-specific vaccine-induced immune responses among HIV-uninfected participants; however, data on immune responses among participants who acquire HIV after vaccination are limited. Here we show that HIV-specific binding antibody responses in individuals with breakthrough HIV infections were not affected by prior vaccination with HIV envelope-containing immunogens. We also found that these vectored vaccines did not prime tier 2 virus-neutralizing antibody responses, which are thought to be required for prevention against HIV acquisition, or accelerate the development of neutralization breadth. Although this study is limited, such studies can provide insights into whether vaccine-elicited antibody responses are boosted by HIV infection to acquire broader neutralizing activity, which may help to identify antigens relevant to the design of more effective vaccines.'),\n",

As a result, HIV-positive patients with diabetes were initially excluded from beta cell replacement therapy. Early reports of pancreas transplant in patients with HIV described high rates of early graft loss with limited follow-up. We report long-term follow-up of islet or pancreas transplantation in HIV-positive type 1 diabetic patients who received a kidney transplant concurrently or had previously undergone kidney transplantation. Although 4 patients developed polyoma viremia, highly active antiretroviral therapy and adequate infectious prophylaxis were successful in providing protection until CD4+ counts recovered. Coordination with HIV providers is critical to reduce the risk of rejection by minimizing drug-drug interactions. Also, protocols for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections and strategies for monitoring and treating BK viremia are important given the degree of immunosuppression required. This series demonstrates that type 1 diabetic patients with well-controlled HIV and renal failure can be appropriate candidates for beta cell replacement, with a low rate of infectious complications, early graft loss, and rejection, so excellent long-term graft survival is possible.

A multicentre, single-blind randomised controlled trial with 160 participants recruited was conducted to determine whether the multimodal peer-led intervention reduced pain in different populations of both male and female South Africans LWHA. Participants were followed up at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 to evaluate effects on the primary outcome of pain, and on depression, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life. We were unable to assess the efficacy of the intervention due to a 58% loss to follow-up (LTFU). Secondary analysis of the LTFU found that sociocultural factors were not predictive of LTFU. Depression, however, did associate with LTFU, with greater severity of depressive symptoms predicting LTFU at week 8 (P = 0.01). We were unable to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention due to the high LTFU and the risk of retention bias. The different sociocultural context in South Africa may warrant a different approach to interventions for pain in HIV compared with resource-rich countries, including a concurrent strategy to address barriers to health care service delivery. We suggest that assessment of pain and depression need to occur simultaneously in those with pain in HIV. We suggest investigation of the effect of social inclusion on pain and depression.'),\n",

Objectives: We investigated whether in individuals with HIV-SN, having pain at the ankle skin biopsy site was associated with lower IENFD compared to when there was no pain at the ankle biopsy site. Methods: We recruited 15 individuals with symptomatic HIV-SN. Nine had pain at the site where the ankle biopsy was taken, whereas 6 did not. Skin punch biopsies for IENFD quantification were taken from the ankle and the thigh. Contrasts between the 2 groups were made using the overlap of confidence interval (CI) method. Results: Intraepidermal nerve fiber density was substantially lower in the group that had pain at the site of the ankle biopsy compared with the other group (6.6 [CI: 5.3-7.2] vs 3.3 [CI: 10.0-15.0] fibers/mm).

METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective survey of 1,171 mother-infant pairs with HIV-exposed infants aged 4-12 weeks who were recruited from 151 immunization clinics from February to August 2013. HIV-exposed infants were followed until diagnosed with HIV, death, or age 18 months. Findings were weighted and adjusted for complex survey design and nonresponse. RESULTS: The 18-month cumulative MTCT risk was highest among adolescent aged </=19 years (12%) followed by young women aged 20-24 years (7.5%) and adult women aged >/=25 years (6.9%). Across these groups, more than 94% had >/=1 antenatal care visit by 21 weeks of gestation, more than 95% had >/=1 HIV test, and more than 98% knew their HIV status. Of known HIV-positive mothers, maternal antiretroviral medication coverage during pregnancy was 76.8% (95% confidence interval: 65.1-85.5), 83.8% (78.6-87.9), and 87.8% (84.6-90.4) among adolescent, young women, and adult mothers, respectively. Among HIV-positive mothers diagnosed prenatally, the adjusted odds ratio of no ARV use during pregnancy was increased among those who had no antenatal care attendance (adjusted odds ratio: 7.7 [3.7-16.0]), no HIV testing (7.3 [2.3-23.5]), no prepartum CD4 count testing (2.1 [1.3-3.4]), and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy (2.9 [1.8-4.8]).

Data on population sizes of PWID living with HIV are needed to inform the implementation of prevention, treatment and care programs. We estimated national population sizes of people who recently (past 12 months) injected drugs living with HIV and evaluated ecological associations with HIV prevalence in PWID. METHODS: We used national data on the prevalence of injecting drug use and of HIV among PWID, derived from systematic reviews, to estimate national population sizes of PWID living with HIV. Uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 draws. We extracted data on sample characteristics from studies of HIV prevalence among PWID, and identified national indicators that have been observed or hypothesised to be associated with HIV prevalence in PWID. We used linear regression to evaluate associations between these variables and HIV prevalence in PWID. RESULTS: Four countries comprised 55% of the estimated global population of PWID living with HIV: Russia (572,500; 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 235,500-1,036,500); Brazil (462,000; 95% UI 283,500-674,500); China (316,500; 95% UI 171,500-493,500), and the United States (195,500; 95% UI 80,000-343,000).

CONCLUSION: The countries with the largest populations of PWID living with HIV will need to dramatically scale up prevention, treatment and care interventions to prevent further increases in population size.

TGW reported low PrEP awareness, with moderate acceptability once PrEP was explained. Population-specific facilitators of PrEP acceptability included its perceived effectiveness in the context of challenges to condom use in serodiscordant relationships and forced sex encounters. PrEP was considered especially appropriate for TGW sex workers; however, barriers were anticipated in the context of hierarchical hijra (indigenous trans identity) kinship networks and gurus' (masters) potential negative reactions to PrEP use by their chelas (disciples). Positive attitudes toward high efficacy and potential covert use were tempered by TGW's concerns about high costs and adherence challenges living with parents or primary partners, and TGW sex workers' unpredictable schedules. Anticipated interactions with feminizing hormones, visible side effects, and PrEP-related stigma within TGW communities emerged as opportunity costs. PrEP implementation for TGW in India should promote comprehensive information on side effects and potential interactions with feminizing hormones, provide free or subsidized PrEP, and highlight the advantages of added protection in sex work and forced sexual encounters.

Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV-1 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high-affinity rhodamine-dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA-AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome-resident two-pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium-mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation.

By intraperitoneal administration of checkpoint antibodies in mice we observed an induction of anti-drug antibodies which may interfere with immunomodulation by checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, we blocked immune checkpoints locally by co-electroporation of DNA vaccines encoding the active soluble ectodomains of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), respectively. Plasmid-encoded immune checkpoints did not elicit a detectable antibody response, suggesting no interference with their immunomodulatory effects.

Determining the regions within SERINC5 that provide restrictive activity or Nef sensitivity should inform mechanistic models of the SERINC5/HIV-1 relationship. Here, we report that deletion of the conserved sequence EDTEE, which is located within a cytoplasmic loop of SERINC5 and which is reminiscent of an acidic-cluster membrane trafficking signal, increases the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by Nef, while it has no effect on the intrinsic activity of the protein as an inhibitor of infectivity. These effects correlated with enhanced removal of the DeltaEDTEE mutant relative to that of wild-type SERINC5 from the cell surface and with enhanced exclusion of the mutant protein from virions by Nef. Mutational analysis indicated that the acidic residues, but not the threonine, within the EDTEE motif are important for the relative resistance to Nef. Deletion of the EDTEE sequence did not increase the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by the glycoGag protein of MLV, suggesting that its virologic role is Nef specific. These results are consistent with the reported mapping of the cytoplasmic loop that contains the EDTEE sequence as a general determinant of Nef responsiveness, but they further indicate that sequences inhibitory to as well as supportive of Nef activity reside in this region. We speculate that the EDTEE motif might have evolved to mediate resistance against retroviruses that use Nef-like proteins to antagonize SERINC5.IMPORTANCE Cellular membrane proteins in the SERINC family, especially SERINC5, inhibit the infectivity of retroviral virions. This inhibition is counteracted by retroviral proteins, specifically, HIV-1 Nef, MLV glycoGag, and EIAV S2. One consequence of such a host-pathogen \"arms race\" is a compensatory change in the host antiviral protein as it evolves to escape the effects of viral antagonists. This is often reflected in a genetic signature, positive selection, which is conspicuously missing in SERINC5 Here we show that despite this lack of genetic evidence, a sequence in SERINC5 nonetheless provides relative resistance to antagonism by HIV-1 Nef.'),\n",

RESULTS: PHFS was associated with an increase in exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) (P = 0.08), 12-month retention in care (P < 0.001), and completeness of child 18-month HIV test results (P = 0.13) at demonstration facilities during program implementation. MTCT at 18 months decreased, but did not differ between groups. Increases in EBF (P = 0.67) and retention in care (P = 0.16) were sustained, and data completeness (P = 0.10) continued to increase at demonstration facilities after the program. PHFS was associated with an increase in EBF (P < 0.001) at scale-up facilities, but there was no difference between groups for retention in care, MTCT, or data completeness. Gains in EBF were lost (P = 0.08) and retention in care declined (P < 0.001) at scale-up facilities after the program. CONCLUSION: PHFS' quality improvement approach increased EBF, retention in care, and data completeness in demonstration facilities during the program and these benefits were sustained.\"),\n",

       "  \"SELPHI involves two interventions: (A) It provides one HIV self-testing (HIVST) kit; (B) It offers 3-monthly repeat HIVST kits if participants report ongoing risk. A logic model underpinned by the Behaviour Change Wheel informed the design of the intervention. SELPHI recruited 10,135 cis-men and trans people in England and Wales, all reporting anal sex with a man. This paper explores how the interventions were experienced and the pathways to impact for different groups of trial participants. In-depth interviews with 37 cis-men who have sex with men (MSM) were used to inductively categorise participants based on sexual and HIV testing histories. Themes relating to intervention experiences and impacts were mapped onto SELPHI-hypothesised intermediate outcomes to consider intervention impacts. Three groups were identified: 'Inexperienced testers' engaged with SELPHI to overcome motivational and social and physical opportunity testing barriers. For 'pro self-testers', testing frequency was constrained by psychological and social barriers and lack of opportunity. 'Opportunistic adopters' engaged in HIVST for novelty and convenience. Perceived impacts for inexperienced testers were most closely aligned with the logic model, but for opportunistic adopters there was little evidence of impact. Distinctive groups were discernible with divergent intervention experiences. Using COM-B as a model for understanding behaviour change in relation to HIVST, our results indicate how HIVST interventions could be adapted to respond to different needs based on the target population's demographic and behavioural features.\"),\n",

This study assessed implementation of SDI over time in two South African districts, describing the characteristics of same-day initiators and evaluating the impact of SDI on retention in ART care. Routine data were analysed for HIV-infected adults who were newly initiating ART in Johannesburg or Mopani Districts between October 2017 and June 2018. Characteristics of same-day ART initiators were compared to later initiators, and losses to follow-up (LTFU) to six months were assessed using Kaplan Meier survival analysis and multivariate logistic regression. The dataset comprised 32 290 records (29 964 from Johannesburg and 2 326 from Mopani). The overall rate of SDI was 40.4% (n = 13 038), increasing from 30.3% in October 2017 to 54.2% in June 2018. Same-day ART initiators were younger, more likely to be female and presented with less advanced clinical disease than those initiating treatment at later times following diagnosis (p<0.001 for all). SDI was associated with disengagement from care: LTFU was 30.1% in the SDI group compared to 22.4%, 19.8% and 21.9% among clients initiating ART 1-7 days, 8-21 days and >/=22 days after HIV diagnosis, respectively (p<0.001). LTFU was significantly more likely among clients in Johannesburg versus Mopani (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.43, p<0.001) and among same-day versus later initiators (aOR = 1.45, p<0.001), while increasing age reduced LTFU (aOR = 0.97, p<0.001). In conclusion, SDI has increased over time as per national guidelines, but there is serious concern regarding the reduced rate of retention among same-day initiators. Nevertheless, SDI may result in a net programmatic benefit provided that interventions are implemented to support client readiness for treatment and ongoing engagement in ART care, particularly among younger adults in large ART programmes such as Johannesburg.'),\n",

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention strategy that may reduce HIV anxiety among GBM. METHODS: The Following Lives Undergoing Change (Flux) Study is a national, online, open-prospective observational study of licit and illicit drug use among GBM in Australia. In 2018, participants responded to newly included items regarding anxiety about HIV transmission. Stratifying GBM as high or low risk as determined by the Australian PrEP Guidelines, we assess whether PrEP use is associated with lower levels of HIV anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare factors associated with PrEP use among GBM at high risk (PrEP-eligible) and low risk (PrEP-ineligible) of HIV infection. Results are reported as adjusted odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among 1547 men, the mean age was 37.1 years (SD 13.1). Men aged 25 years or younger had higher HIV anxiety scores than older men. Among PrEP-eligible men, men who use PrEP reported lower levels of HIV anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 0.92; 95% confidence interval = 0.87 to 0.99; P < 0.001). No differences were observed on HIV anxiety among PrEP-ineligible men. CONCLUSIONS: Among PrEP-eligible men, PrEP use was independently associated with lower levels of HIV anxiety. In addition to avoiding HIV infection, PrEP use may help reduce anxiety among men at risk of HIV. This feature of PrEP could be promoted as part of demand creation initiatives to increase PrEP uptake.'),\n",

Little is known about the prevalence and incidence of MG in pregnant women. Our study sought to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of MG infection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 197 women >/=18 years receiving antenatal care in South Africa from November 2017 to February 2019. We over-recruited HIV-infected pregnant women to compare MG by HIV infection status. Self-collected vaginal swabs, performed at the first antenatal visit, third trimester and within 1 week post partum, were tested for MG using the Aptima assay (Hologic, USA). We report on the prevalence and incidence of MG and used multivariable logistic regression to describe correlates of MG and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes (preterm delivery, miscarriage and vertical HIV transmission), adjusting for maternal age and HIV infection status. RESULTS: At first antenatal visit, the median age was 29 years (IQR=24-34) and the gestational age was 19 weeks (IQR=14-23); 47% of women enrolled in the study were HIV-infected. MG prevalence was 24% (95% CI 16% to 34%, n=22) in HIV-infected and 12% (95% CI 6.8% to 20%, n=13) in HIV-uninfected pregnant women. MG incidence during pregnancy and early post partum was 4.7 infections per 100 woman-years (95% CI 1.2 to 12.9) or 3.9 per 1000 woman-months (95% CI 1.0 to 10.7). Adjusting for maternal age, HIV-infected women had over three times the odds of being infected with MG (adjusted OR=3.09, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.06). CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence and incidence of MG in pregnant women. Younger maternal age and HIV infection were associated with MG infection in pregnancy. Further research into birth outcomes of women infected with MG, including vertical transmission of HIV infection, is needed.'),\n",

We assessed serum CMV-IgG, systolic- (SBP) and diastolic- (DBP) blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), traditional risk factors, activated CD8+ T-cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), senescent CD8+ T-cells (CD28-CD57+) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 60 PLHIV and 31 HIV-uninfected controls matched on age, gender, education and comorbidity. In PLHIV, expression of interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma was measured by intracellular-cytokine-staining after stimulation of T-cells with CMV-pp65 and CMV-gB. Associations between CMV-specific immune responses and hypertension, SBP, DBP or PP were assessed by multivariate logistic and linear regression models adjusted for appropriate confounders. The median age of PLHIV was 47 years and 90% were male. Prevalence of hypertension in PLHIV was 37% compared to 55% of HIV-uninfected controls. CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were independently associated with higher PP (CMV-pp65; beta = 2.29, p = 0.001, CMV-gB; beta = 2.42, p = 0.001) in PLHIV. No significant differences were found with regard to individual measures of SBP and DBP. A possible weak association was found between CMV-IgG and hypertension (beta = 1.33, p = 0.049) after adjustment for age, smoking and LDL-cholesterol. HIV-related factors, IL-6, CD8+ T-cell activation or CD8+ T-cell senescence did not mediate the associations, and no associations were found between CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and blood pressure in PLHIV. In conclusion, increased arterial blood pressure in PLHIV may be affected by heightened CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses.'),\n",

The modest efficacy (31.2%) of the phase III RV144 clinical trial provided the first demonstration that a prophylactic HIV/AIDS vaccine is achievable but emphasized the need for further refinements of vaccine candidates, formulations, and immunization regimens. Here, we analyzed in mice the immunogenicity profile elicited by different homologous and heterologous prime/boost combinations using the modified rhabdovirus VSV-GP combined with DNA or poxviral NYVAC vectors, all expressing trimeric membrane-bound Env (gp145) of HIV-1 96ZM651 clade C, with or without purified gp140 protein component. In cultured cells infected with recombinant VSV-GP or NYVAC viruses, gp145 epitopes at the plasma membrane were recognized by human HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). In immunized mice, the heterologous combination of VSV-GP and NYVAC recombinant vectors improved the induction of HIV-1 Env-specific humoral and cellular immune responses compared to homologous prime/boost protocols. Specifically, the combination of VSV-GP in the prime and NYVAC in the boost induced higher HIV-1 Env-specific T cell (CD4/CD8 T cells and T follicular helper -Tfh- cells) immune responses compared to the use of DNA or NYVAC vectors in the prime and VSV-GP in the boost. Such enhanced T cell responses correlated with an enhancement of the Env-specific germinal center (GC) B cell population and with a heavily biased Env-specific response toward the Th1-associated IgG2a and IgG3 subclasses, while the other groups showed a Th2-associated IgG1 bias. In summary, our T and B cell population data demonstrated that VSV-GP-based vectors could be taken into consideration as an optimized immunogenic HIV-1 vaccine candidate component against HIV-1 when used for priming in heterologous combinations with the poxvirus vector NYVAC as a boost.'),\n",

Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NP-AEs) have been reported with DTG but neuropsychiatric symptoms have not been systemically quantified using structured scales. This study examined mood and cognitive parameters before and after a planned transition from non-DTG to DTG-based ART within a longitudinal study of acute HIV infection (AHI). METHODS: RV254 AHI cohort participants on >/= 24 weeks of ART initiated at AHI underwent sequential assessments before and after the switch including: (1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item survey (scores 0-27) that evaluates somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression; (2) a 2-Questions screening that has been validated locally for depression; (3) Distress Thermometer (scores 0-10); and 4) administration of a 4-test neurocognitive battery sensitive to HIV. RESULTS: 254 individuals (95% male, median age 30) switched to a DTG-based regimen after a median 144 weeks of ART. Serial assessments were completed at a median of 19 weeks before and 37 weeks after DTG. There was a modest but statistically significant increase in PHQ-9 scores after DTG (pre-switch: 5 [IQR 1-7] vs. Post-switch: 5 [IQR 2-8], p = 0.009). The percentage of participants with at least moderate depression (PHQ-9 >/= 10) increased from 10 to 16% (p = 0.006), but the frequency of moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9 >/= 15) remained unchanged (3%). No volunteer reported NP-AEs within the study period. Somatic symptoms of depression increased more than cognitive/affective symptoms. Plasma viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50; p = 0.005) and PHQ-9 >/= 10 (p < 0.001) before switch were linked to lower PHQ-9 scores after DTG in multivariable analysis. Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except grooved pegboard test, improved modestly after DTG (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: After a median duration of 37 weeks of DTG use, there was a modest increase in the higher quartile of PHQ-9. This increase was associated with a rise in moderate depression symptoms but not the more severe forms of depression on PHQ-9. No clinically relevant NP-AEs were reported.

We used a randomized survey to examine whether PLWHIV had a different willingness to take a hypothetical HIV medication if it causes flu-like symptoms, but provides: (a) cure, (b) remission that was labeled \"cure\", or (c) remission. PLWHIV (n = 454) were more willing to take a medication that provided a \"cure\" versus a \"remission\" if the side effects lasted less than 1 year. PLWHIV were more willing to take a medication that provided a remission that was labeled \"cure\" versus a \"remission\" (p = 0.01) if the side effects lasted 2 weeks.

       "  'Background: Integrase inhibitors (INI) induce a rapid decline of HIV-RNA in plasma and CD4(+) T-cell recovery in blood. Both characteristics are also associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Whether the use of INI-containing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) increases the risk of IRIS is being questioned. Methods: Study within the Dutch ATHENA HIV observational cohort. HIV-1 infected late presenters initiating cART after March 2009 were included if they had <200 CD4(+) T-cells per muL and were diagnosed with an opportunistic infection. IRIS was defined either according to the criteria by French et al. (IRISFRENCH) or by a clinical IRIS diagnosis of the physician (IRISCLINICAL). The primary outcomes were the association between INI and the occurrence of IRISFRENCH and IRISFRENCH+CLINICAL in multivariable logistic regression. Findings: 672 patients with a median CD4(+) T-cell count of 35 cells per muL were included. Treatment with INI was independently associated with IRISFRENCH as well as IRISFRENCH+CLINICAL (OR 2.43, 95%CI:1.45-4.07, and OR 2.17, 95%CI:1.45-3.25). When investigating INI separately, raltegravir (RAL) remained significantly associated with IRISFRENCH (OR 4.04 (95%CI:1.99-8.19) as well as IRISFRENCH+CLINICAL (OR 3.07, 95%CI:1.66-5.69), while dolutegravir (DTG) became associated with IRISFRENCH+CLINICAL after it replaced RAL as preferred INI in the cohort after 2015 (OR 4.08, 95%CI:0.99-16.82, p=0.052). Too few patients used elvitegravir to draw meaningful conclusions. Steroid initiation for IRIS was more likely in those who initiated INI versus in those who did not, but no increased hospital (re)admission or mortality rates were observed. Interpretation: In HIV late presenters from a resource rich setting, INI based treatment initiation increased the risk of IRIS. This was observed for RAL and DTG when being initiated as preferential INI in the presence of specific AIDS-conditions, indicative of channeling bias. Although we controlled for all relevant measured confounders, we cannot exclude that the observed association is partially explained by residual confounding. INI use was not associated with mortality nor hospitalization. Therefore, our observation is no reason to avoid INI in late presenters.

In this study, we assess the impact of the entire data audit process on subsequent statistical analyses. METHODS: We conducted on-site audits of datasets from nine international HIV care sites. Error rates were quantified for key demographic and clinical variables among a subset of records randomly selected for auditing. Based on audit results, some sites were tasked with targeted validation of high-error-rate variables resulting in a post-audit dataset. We estimated the times from antiretroviral therapy initiation until death and first AIDS-defining event using the pre-audit data, the audit data, and the post-audit data. RESULTS: The overall discrepancy rate between pre-audit and audit data (n = 250) across all audited variables was 17.1%. The estimated probability of mortality and an AIDS-defining event over time was higher in the audited data relative to the pre-audit data. Among patients represented in both the post-audit and pre-audit cohorts (n = 18,999), AIDS and mortality estimates also were higher in the post-audit data. CONCLUSION: Though some changes may have occurred independently, our findings suggest that improved data quality following the audit may impact epidemiological inferences.'),\n",

Sending reminders via SMS is expected to improve adherence. We conducted a pilot study to investigate acceptability, user experience and technical feasibility of sending reminder-SMS to WLHIV. Methods: This was a 6-months observational pilot-study among WLHIV attending antenatal and postnatal care at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, Tanzania. Women received a reminder-SMS 30 minutes before usual time of intake. One hour later, they received an SMS asking whether they took medication to which they could reply with \\'Yes\\' or \\'No\\'. Messages were sent 3 times a week on randomly chosen days to prevent reliance on daily messages. We calculated the percentage of number of SMS delivered, failed to be delivered, and replied to. We analysed feedback from exit-interviews about experience with the SMS-reminders. Results: 25 women were enrolled (age 18-45), 2 were lost to follow up. 5,054 messages were sent of which 53 failed to be delivered (1%). 1,880 SMS were sent with a question if medication was taken; 1,012 (54%) messages were replied to, of which 1,003 (99%) were replied with \\'YES\\' and closely to \\'YES\\', and a total of 9 (1%) with \\'NO\\' and \\'closely to NO\\'. 868 messages (46%) were not responded to due to either dropout, change of phone number, loss of phone or network failure. Results from 18 interviews showed that 16 (89%) women were satisfied with SMS reminders. 2 (11%) were concerned about unwanted disclosure because of the content \\'don\\'t forget to take medication\\' and one reported other privacy issues (6%). 3 (17%) women experienced stigma. Conclusion: 99%of SMS being delivered indicates that SMS reminders in this resource-limited setting are technically feasible. However, concerns regarding privacy were noted, specifically the risk of unwanted disclosure and the experience of stigma. Participants indicated that being made aware of their adherence, motivated them to adhere better. However, personalised and more neutral content of the SMS might be a way to improving the intervention.'),\n",

       "  'While the HVTN 505 trial showed no overall efficacy of the tested vaccine to prevent HIV infection over placebo, markers measuring immune response to vaccination were strongly correlated with infection. This finding generated the hypothesis that some marker-defined vaccinated subgroups were partially protected whereas others had their risk increased. This hypothesis can be assessed using the principal stratification framework (Frangakis and Rubin, 2002) for studying treatment effect modification by an intermediate response variable, using methods in the sub-field of principal surrogate (PS) analysis that studies multiple principal strata. Unfortunately, available methods for PS analysis require an augmented study design not available in HVTN 505, and make untestable structural risk assumptions, motivating a need for more robust PS methods. Fortunately, another sub-field of principal stratification, survivor average causal effect (SACE) analysis (Rubin, 2006) - which studies effects in a single principal stratum - provides many methods not requiring an augmented design and making fewer assumptions. We show how, for a binary intermediate response variable, methods developed for SACE analysis can be adapted to PS analysis, providing new and more robust PS methods. Application to HVTN 505 supports that the vaccine partially protected individuals with vaccine-induced T-cells expressing certain combinations of functions.')]"
