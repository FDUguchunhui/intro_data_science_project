Systemic inflammation (SI) is associated with death among children with SM and is negatively associated with linear growth. However, the relationship between SI and weight gain during therapeutic feeding following acute illness is unknown. We hypothesised that growth post-hospital discharge is associated with SI among children with SM. Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of data from HIV-uninfected children with SM (n=98) who survived and were not readmitted to hospital during one year of follow-up. We examined the relationship between changes in absolute deficits in weight and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) from enrolment at stabilisation to 60 days and one year later, and untargeted plasma proteome, targeted cytokines/chemokines, leptin, and soluble CD14 using multivariate regularized linear regression. Results: The mean change in absolute deficit in weight and MUAC was -0.50kg (standard deviation; SD+/-0.69) and -1.20cm (SD+/-0.89), respectively, from enrolment to 60 days later. During the same period, mean weight and MUAC gain was 3.3g/kg/day (SD+/-2.4) and 0.22mm/day (SD+/-0.2), respectively. Enrolment interleukins; IL17-alpha and IL-2, and serum amyloid P were negatively associated with weight and MUAC gain during 60 days. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein and complement component 2 were negatively associated with weight gain only. Leptin was positively associated with weight gain. Soluble CD14, beta-2 microglobulin, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta were negatively associated with MUAC gain only. Glutathione peroxidase 3 was positively associated with weight and MUAC gain during one year. Conclusions: Early post-hospital discharge weight and MUAC gain were rapid and comparable to children with uncomplicated SM treated in the community. Higher concentrations of SI markers were associated with less weight and MUAC gain, suggesting inflammation negatively impacts recovery from wasting. This finding warrants further research on reducing inflammation on growth among children with SM.')\n",

Low serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels have been associated with falls, fractures and poor muscle strength. We hypothesized that vitamin D (VitD) supplementation would improve muscle strength in postmenopausal PLWH. METHODS: In a 12-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, study of 69 African American and Hispanic postmenopausal PLWH on antiretroviral therapy with 25-OHD >/=10 ng/ml and </=32 ng/ml, we investigated the effects of daily low (1,000 IU; n=31) and moderate (3,000 IU; n=38) cholecalciferol doses on lean mass and strength. Change in lean body mass was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and isometric and isokinetic muscle strength in the dominant lower extremity was assessed using the Biodex System 4 Pro. RESULTS: Mean age was 56 +/-5 years, median CD4(+) T-cell count 722 cells/mm(3) and 74% had HIV RNA</=50 copies/ml. Serum 25-OHD did not differ at baseline, but was higher in the moderate than low VitD group at 6 and 12 months. In both groups, there were significant increases in lower extremity isokinetic torque, work and power at 12 months, with no change in lean mass. CONCLUSIONS: VitD supplementation was associated with a modest increase in lower extremity strength in postmenopausal PLWH, without a concomitant increase in muscle mass. Magnitude of increase in strength were similar with 3,000 IU and 1,000 IU daily. Future larger studies will be required to determine the optimal dose of VitD to improve muscle strength and to determine whether supplementation reduces the risk of falls and fractures in PLWH.')\n",

SERINC5 is a potent host restriction factor and antagonized by HIV-1 Nef and two other retroviral accessory proteins via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Here, we investigated human SERINC4 expression and antiviral mechanisms. Unlike its four paralogs, human SERINC4 is subjected to proteasome-mediated turnover, resulting in ~250-fold lower expression than SERINC5. However, when expression was normalized, human SERINC4 restricted HIV-1 replication as effectively as SERINC5, and SERINC4 was also antagonized by Nef via the lysosomal pathway. Although SERINC4 proteins are conserved within primates or rodents, their N-terminal regions are highly variable across species. Interestingly, unlike human SERINC4, murine SERINC4 was stably expressed but had a very poor antiviral activity. We created stable SERINC4 chimeras by replacing the N-terminal region and found that the 1-34 and 35-92 amino acids determine SERINC4 antiviral activity or protein expression, respectively. Using these chimeras, we demonstrate that SERINC4 is incorporated into HIV-1 virions and restricts Tier 1 HIV-1 more effectively than Tier 3 HIV-1. Importantly, SERINC4 increases HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, human SERINC4 strongly restricts HIV-1 replication when it is overexpressed, which reflects a potential antiviral activity of this gene product under physiological conditions.')\n",

Despite clear procedures, the disclosure rate in Tanzania remains relatively low. This study assessed the factors associated with HIV status disclosure to orphans and vulnerable children living with HIV (OVCLHIV). Methods: Data for this analysis come from the USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya program in Tanzania that provides health and social services to OVC and caregivers of HIV-affected households. Data were collected between January 2018 and March 2019. Disclosure status was self-reported by caregivers of children aged 8 years or above. Beneficiary characteristics were included as independent variables. Generalized estimating equations took into account the clustering effect of the study design. Results: Of the 10673 OVCLHIV, most were females (52.43%), and 80.67% were enrolled in school. More than half (54.89%) were from households in rural areas. Caregivers were mostly females (70.66%), three quarters were between 31 and 60 years old and had a complete primary education (67.15%), and 57.75% were HIV-infected. Most of the OVCLHIV (87.31%) had a disclosed HIV status.

Knowledge of one's HIV status may encourage preventive behaviors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many international students may be willing to accept HIV screening, but empirical evidence to support this claim is lacking. We sought to determine the willingness of international students in the United States (US) to accept HIV screening, if offered. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey of international students at Western Illinois University, USA. The independent variable was the sociodemographic data of our participants; the dependent variable was the acceptance of HIV screening. The covariates were knowledge about HIV and the factors associated with the acceptance of the screening. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were conducted. Results: A total of 185 respondents out of 491 students participated in the online survey. Of these, 107 (57.8%) were males, and 78 (42.8%) were females. Most of the respondents were from Asian countries (64.9%) and African countries (24.9%). The prevalence of acceptance of HIV screening was 74%. Among participants willing to accept screening, if offered, 90% perceived screening would be beneficial to their health. Meanwhile, 83% of those who would refuse the screening were not sexually active. Conclusion and Global Health Implications: Many international students may be interested in getting HIV screening if offered. Awareness of the benefits of HIV screening may influence the decision to screen. Findings may inform further studies that will lead to policy formulations for the health of international students in the US.\")\n",

Isoniazid is critical for treating tuberculosis globally and is a component of most regimens to prevent tuberculosis. Isoniazid may contribute to pellagra by disrupting intracellular niacin synthesis. In 2017, Malawian clinicians recognized a high incidence of pellagra-like rashes after scale-up of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) to people living with HIV (PLHIV). This increase in pellagra incidence among PLHIV coincided with a seasonal period of sustained food insecurity in the region, which obscured epidemiological interpretations. Although isoniazid has been implicated as a secondary cause of pellagra for decades, no hypothesis-driven epidemiological study has assessed this relationship in a population exposed to isoniazid. We developed this case-control protocol to assess the association between large-scale isoniazid distribution and pellagra in Malawi. Methods: We measure the relative odds of having pellagra among isoniazid-exposed people compared to those without exposure while controlling for other pellagra risk factors. Secondary aims include measuring time from isoniazid initiation to onset of dermatitis, comparing niacin metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MN), and l-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-PYR) in urine as a proxy for total body niacin status among subpopulations, and describing clinical outcomes after 30-days multi-B vitamin (containing 300 mg nicotinamide daily) therapy and isoniazid cessation (if exposed). We aim to enroll 197 participants with pellagra and 788 age- and sex-matched controls (1:4 ratio) presenting at three dermatology clinics. Four randomly selected community clinics within 3-25 km of designated dermatology clinics will refer persons with pellagra-like symptoms to one of the study enrollment sites for diagnosis. Trained study dermatologists will conduct a detailed exposure questionnaire and perform anthropometric measurements. A subset of enrollees will provide a casual urine specimen for niacin metabolites quantification and/or point-of-care isoniazid detection to confirm whether participants recently ingested isoniazid.

Blood samples from a cross-sectional study of asymptomatic adult Kenyans enrolled during voluntary HIV testing were analyzed by PCR for Plasmodium spp. More than 95% of volunteers with identifiable parasite species (132 HIV-1 co-infected) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum alone or P. falciparum with Plasmodium ovale and/or Plasmodium malariae. Deep sequencing was used to screen for mutations in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) (N51I, C59R, S108N, I164L) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) (S436H, A437G, K540E, A581G) from 1133 volunteers. Individual mutations in DHPS but not DHFR correlated with HIV-1 status. DHFR haplotype diversity was significantly different among volunteers by gender and HIV-1 status. DHPS haplotype diversity by HIV-1 status was significantly different between volunteers paired by age and gender, indicating that patterns of resistance were independent of these variables. Molecular simulations for a novel DHPS mutation (I504T) suggested that the mutated protein has increased affinity for the endogenous ligand DHPPP and decreased affinity for drug binding. A sub-group of monoclonal infections revealed that age and parasitemia were not correlated and enabled identification of a rare septuple-mutant haplotype (IRNL-HGEA). In our study, adult Kenyans newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection were predominantly infected with moderately resistant P. falciparum, with patterns of infecting parasite genotypes significantly associated with HIV-1 status. Together with the discovery of DHPS I504T, these data indicate that antifolate resistance continues to evolve in Kenya.

While participation in HIV research was driven by survival in the 1980's and early 1990's, access to novel therapies became the primary motivator with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the late 1990s. In the HIV cure-related research context, the concept of altruism has remained insufficiently studied. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to better contextualize and understand how altruism is or could be operationalized in HIV cure-related research. We drew from the fields of altruism in general, clinical research, cancer, and HIV clinical research-including the HIV prevention, treatment, and cure-related research fields. Discussion: Altruism as a key motivating factor for participation in clinical research has often been intertwined with the desire for personal benefit. The cancer field informs us that reasons for participation usually are multi-faceted and complex. The HIV prevention field offers ways to organize altruism-either by the types of benefits achieved (e.g., societal versus personal), or the origin of the values that motivate research participation. The HIV treatment literature reveals the critical role of clinical interactions in fostering altruism. There remains a dearth of in-depth knowledge regarding reasons surrounding research participation and the types of altruism displayed in HIV cure-related clinical research. Conclusion: Lessons learned from various research fields can guide questions which will inform the assessment of altruism in future HIV cure-related research.\")\n",

As an individual progresses from the founder to chronic stage of infection, immune pressure forces a history of mutations that are embedded in envelope sequences. Determining this pathway of coevolving mutations can assist in understanding what is different with the founder virus and the essential pathways it takes to maintain infection. We have combined operations research and bioinformatics methods to extract key networks of mutations that differentiate founder and chronic stages for 156 subtype B and 107 subtype C envelope (gp160) sequences. The chronic networks for both subtypes revealed strikingly different hub-and-spoke topologies compared to the less structured transmission networks. This suggests that the hub nodes are impacted by the immune response and the resulting loss of fitness is compensated by mutations at the spoke positions. The major hubs in the chronic C network occur at positions 12, 137 (within the N136 glycan), and 822, and at position 306 for subtype B. While both founder networks had a more heterogeneous connected network structure, interestingly founder B subnetworks around positions 640 and 837 preferentially contained CD4 and coreceptor binding domains. Finally, we observed a differential effect of glycosylation between founder and chronic subtype B where the latter had mutational pathways significantly driven by N-glycosylation. Our study provides insights into the mutational pathways HIV takes to evade the immune response, and presents features more likely to establish founder infection, valuable for effective vaccine design.')\n",

In 2015, the sample design and frame of MMP changed from a system that only included HIV patients to one that captures the experiences of persons receiving and not receiving HIV care. We describe methods investigated for calculating survey weights, the approach chosen, and the benefits of using a dynamic surveillance registry as a sampling frame. METHODS: MMP samples adults with diagnosed HIV from the National HIV Surveillance System, the HIV case surveillance registry for the United States. In the methodological study presented in this manuscript, we compared methods that account for sample design and nonresponse, including weighting class adjustment vs. propensity weighting and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment vs. sequential adjustments for noncontact and nonresponse. We investigated how best to adjust for non-coverage using surveillance data to post-stratify estimates. RESULTS: After assessing these methods, we chose as our preferred procedure weighting class adjustments and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment. Classes were constructed using variables associated with respondents' characteristics and important survey outcomes, chief among them laboratory results available from surveillance that served as a proxy for medical care. CONCLUSIONS: MMPs weighting procedures reduced sample bias by leveraging auxiliary information on medical care available from the surveillance registry sampling frame. Expanding MMPs population of focus provides important information on characteristics of persons with diagnosed HIV that complement the information provided by the surveillance registry.

The impact of alcohol on viral suppression is particularly important among groups at high risk of HIV transmission, such as female sex workers (FSWs). Few studies have directly evaluated the association between alcohol use and HIV viral load. We hypothesized that hazardous or harmful alcohol use is associated with detectable plasma viral load among HIV-positive FSWs. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-positive FSWs in Mombasa, Kenya. Hazardous or harmful alcohol use was assessed yearly and defined as an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score >/=7. Detectable viral load was assessed every six months and defined as >/=180 c/mL. Adherence measures were collected monthly and included late ART refill (>48 hours) and self-reported adherence, using both a validated self-rating scale of ability to take medication and visual analog scale (VAS) of ART use in the last month. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: This analysis included 366 participants followed monthly between October 2012 and March 2018. At baseline, AUDIT scores indicated hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT 7-15) in 14.3%, harmful alcohol use (AUDIT 16-19) in 1.4%, and alcohol dependency (AUDIT >/=20) in 1.4% of participants. After adjusting for potential confounders, a combined exposure including hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol use was not associated with detectable viral load (aRR 1.10, 95%CI 0.63-1.92) or late ART refill (aRR 1.13, 95%CI 0.82-1.56), but was associated with lower self-rated ability to take medication (aRR 2.38, 95%CI 1.42-3.99) and a lower rate of self-reported perfect ART adherence by VAS (aRR 2.62, 95%CI 1.84-3.71). CONCLUSIONS: In this FSW cohort, while participants reporting hazardous, harmful, or dependent alcohol use were not more likely to have a detectable viral load, they were more likely to report lower ART adherence.

Although antenatal HIV prevalence data are known to be biased representations of HIV prevalence in the general population, mathematical models have made various adjustments to control for known sources of bias, including the effect of HIV on fertility, the age profile of pregnant women and sexual experience. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed whether assumptions about antenatal bias affect conclusions about trends and geographical variation in HIV prevalence, using simulated datasets generated by an agent-based model of HIV and fertility in South Africa. Results suggest that even when controlling for age and other previously-considered sources of bias, antenatal bias in South Africa has not been constant over time, and trends in bias differ substantially by age. Differences in the average duration of infection explain much of this variation. We propose an HIV duration-adjusted measure of antenatal bias that is more stable, which yields higher estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Simpler measures of antenatal bias, which are not age-adjusted, yield estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence that are too high in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and that are less precise. Antenatal bias in South Africa is substantially greater in urban areas than in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Age-standardized approaches to defining antenatal bias are likely to improve precision in model-based estimates, and further recency adjustments increase estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Incompletely adjusting for changing antenatal bias may explain why previous model estimates overstated the early HIV burden in South Africa. New assays to estimate the fraction of HIV-positive pregnant women who are recently infected could play an important role in better estimating antenatal bias.')\n",

Current TBM regimen dosages are based on data from pulmonary TB alone. Evidence from recent phase II pharmacokinetic studies suggests that high dose rifampicin (R) administered intravenously or orally enhances central nervous system penetration and may reduce TBM associated mortality. We hypothesize that, among persons with TBM, high dose oral rifampicin (35 mg/kg) for 8 weeks will improve survival compared to standard of care (10 mg/kg), without excess adverse events. Protocol: We will perform a parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, phase III multicentre clinical trial comparing high dose oral rifampicin to standard of care. The trial will be conducted across five clinical sites in Uganda, South Africa and Indonesia. Participants are HIV-positive or negative adults with clinically suspected TBM, who will be randomised (1:1) to one of two arms: 35 mg/kg oral rifampicin daily for 8 weeks (in combination with standard dose isoniazid [H], pyrazinamide [Z] and ethambutol [E]) or standard of care (oral HRZE, containing 10 mg/kg/day rifampicin). The primary end-point is 6-month survival. Secondary end points are: i) 12-month survival ii) functional and neurocognitive outcomes and iii) safety and tolerability. Tertiary outcomes are: i) pharmacokinetic outcomes and ii) cost-effectiveness of the intervention. We will enrol 500 participants over 2.5 years, with follow-up continuing until 12 months post-enrolment. Discussion: Our best TBM treatment still results in unacceptably high mortality and morbidity. Strong evidence supports the increased cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high dose rifampicin, however conclusive evidence regarding survival benefit is lacking. This study will answer the important question of whether high dose oral rifampicin conveys a survival benefit in TBM in HIV-positive and -negative individuals from Africa and Asia.

Multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects multiple regression (GLMM) analyses were used to investigate the association between average pain severity and self-reported inability to access addiction treatment. Results: Among 1348 PWUD, 136 (10.1%) reported being unable to access addiction treatment at least once over the study period.

With the aim of significantly lowering global HIV rates, prevention programs like VMMC make every effort to achieve ambitious targets at an increasingly reduced cost. This has the potential to threaten VMMC program quality. Two measures of program quality are follow-up and adverse event (AE) rates. To inform further VMMC program improvement, ZAZIC conducted a quality assurance (QA) activity to assess if pressure to do more with less influenced program quality. METHODS: Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted at 9 sites with 7 site-based VMMC program officers and 9 ZAZIC roving team members. Confidentiality was ensured to encourage candid conversation on adherence to VMMC standards, methods to increase productivity, challenges to target achievement, and suggestions for program modification. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using Atlas.ti 6. RESULTS: VMMC teams work long hours in diverse community settings to reach ambitious targets. Rotating, large teams of trained VMMC providers ensures meeting demand. Service providers prioritize VMMC safety procedures and implement additional QA measures to prevent AEs among all clients, especially minors. However, KIs noted three areas where pressure for increased numbers of clients diminished adherence to VMMC safety standards. For pre- and post-operative counselling, MC teams may combine individual and group sessions to reach more people, potentially reducing client understanding of critical wound care instructions. Second, key infection control practices may be compromised (handwashing, scrubbing techniques, and preoperative client preparation) to speed MC procedures. Lastly, pressure for client numbers may reduce prioritization of patient follow-up, while client-perceived stigma may reduce care-seeking. Although AEs appear well managed, delays in AE identification and lack of consistent AE reporting compromise program quality. CONCLUSION: In pursuit of ambitious targets, healthcare workers may compromise quality of MC services. Although risk to patients may appear minimal, careful consideration of the realities and risks of ambitious target setting by donors, ministries, and implementing partners could help to ensure that client safety and program quality is consistently prioritized over productivity.')\n",

However, the association between psychoactive substance use and multiple sexual partnerships among young people in informal settlements of low-income countries is not well known. This study established the prevalence of multiple sexual partnerships and associated factors among young psychoactive-substance-users in informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 744 young (aged 18-24 years), sexually active, psychoactive substance-users selected from 12 of the 57 informal settlements of Kampala City. The prevalence of multiple sexual partnerships and their differential distribution by socio-demographic strata was established. Modified Poisson regression models were run in Stata 14 software to generate prevalence rate ratios for the factors associated with multiple sexual partnerships. RESULTS: About 40.6% (37.9% of males and 50.0% of females) had engaged in multiple sexual partnerships in the last 30 days.

We hypothesized that current curves underestimate true ideal birthweight and the prevalence of SGA. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were pooled from two double-blind randomized control trials of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy in Uganda. HIV-negative women without comorbidities were enrolled from 12-20 weeks gestation. Gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound dating. Women were followed through pregnancy and delivery for clinical malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, and placental malaria. Women without malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, or placental malaria formed the malaria negative cohort and generated the Ugandan birthweight standard.

METHODS: We included data on all patients starting ART from 2005 to 2019 in eight South African cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) collaboration. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with having a viral load measurement within 2 months of a scheduled testing date and having a viral load <400 RNA copies/ml ('viral suppression'). In a sensitivity analysis, missing viral loads were imputed based on patients' clinical and demographic characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Viral load tests were scheduled in 603,549 and 77,423 intervals in adults and children, respectively, but test results were recorded in only 40.7% and 41.2%, respectively.

Currently, the immediate start of HAART is recommended for all HIV patients, regardless of the CD4 count. There are several concerns, however, about starting treatment in critically ill patients. Unpredictable absorption of medication by the gastrointestinal tract, drug toxicity, drug interactions, limited reserve to tolerate the dysfunction of other organs resulting from hypersensitivity to drugs or immune reconstitution syndrome, and the possibility that subtherapeutic levels of drug may lead to viral resistance are the main concerns. The objective of our study was to compare the early onset (up to 5 days) with late onset (after discharge from the ICU) of HAART in HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolling HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU of a public hospital in southern Brazil. Patients randomized to the intervention group had to start treatment with HAART within 5 days of ICU admission. For patients in the control group, treatment should begin after discharge from the ICU. The patients were followed up to determine mortality in the ICU, in the hospital and at 6 months. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was mortality at 6 months. RESULTS: The calculated sample size was 344 patients. Unfortunately, we decided to discontinue the study due to a progressively slower recruitment rate. A total of 115 patients were randomized. The majority of admissions were for AIDS-defining illnesses and low CD4. The main cause of admission was respiratory failure. Regarding the early and late study groups, there was no difference in hospital (66.7% and 63.8%, p = 0.75) or 6-month (68.4% and 79.2%, p = 0.20) mortality.

Themes identified in this therapeutic domain of cannabis use include (a) enhanced introspection among individuals that promotes psychological adjustment to an HIV diagnosis, improved medical management, and future orientation; (b) reflection processes that mitigate interpersonal conflict and improve interpersonal communication; and (c) a social-therapeutic phenomena of cannabis use among young persons with living HIV that is characterized by both enhanced introspection and improved interpersonal communication. Our findings suggest a spectrum of cannabis use among HIV+ YMSM that may be characterized not only by an overlap between medical and recreational use, but also by a distinct therapeutic domain that incorporates stress alleviation and cognitive expansion processes to improve focus on HIV management and self-care.')\n",

METHODS: Data for this secondary analysis come from the first two years (2017-2018) of the USAID funded Kizazi Kipya project. Referral success was defined as feedback and service received within 90 days post-referral provision. We analyzed factors that are associated with the referral success of HIV related, education, nutrition, parenting, household economic strengthening, and child protection services among OVC and CG, using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: During the study period, 19,502 CWs in 68 councils provided 146,996 referrals to 132,640 beneficiaries. OVC had much lower referral success for HIV related services (48.1%) than CG (81.2%).

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of peripheral neuropathy amongst persons on HAART attending Comprehensive Care Clinics in Busia County, Kenya. Method: This cross-sectional descriptive quantitative study utilised purposive sampling and included 289 adults living with HIV/AIDS. Data collection was undertaken using the Clinical HIV Associated Neuropathy Tool (CHANT) and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25.0. Results: Of people on HAART, 68.17% (197 amongst 289) had peripheral neuropathy. The majority were female 76.8% (n = 222), 38.1% (n = 110) were between 41 and 50, and 35% (n = 101) were widowed. The most common primary symptom was reduced right foot big toe vibration (76.8%, n = 222). There was a strong positive relationship (r = 0.621, P = 0.000) between foot vibration and illness. There was a statistically significant influence of demographic characteristics of persons on HAART on PN as they accounted for 98.5% of the variance (R (2) = 0.985). Conclusion: Peripheral neuropathy is prevalent and is significantly influenced by socio-demographic characteristics of persons on HAART-PN. Early diagnosis and exercise guidance by physiotherapists is key in forestalling severe symptoms, disability and poor quality of life. Clinical implications: There is need to screen persons living with HIV on HAART for PN to establish their medical, physiotherapy and rehabilitation needs. Early diagnosis will encourage healthcare workers to start interventions to prevent progression of impairment, onset of disability and decrease in quality of life.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted from September 2015 to May 2016 at KCMC. HIV-infected children and adolescents less than 17 years on ARVs for more than 6 months were enrolled. Blood samples were taken to determine levels of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol, lipoproteins (including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)), CD4+ T cells, and viral load (VL). Anthropometric measurements were used to assess nutritional status. SPSS 20.0 was used for analysis. Logistic regression estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and P value <.05 was considered significant.

However, prevention research and programs have focused predominantly on sex workers rather than on their clients, who are generally men. To support effective and targeted interventions, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence of the prevalence of HIV infection among men who purchase sex (MWPS) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the association between HIV infection and purchase of sex. METHODS: We included articles that reported from LMICs on the prevalence of HIV in MWPS and those that reported on HIV prevalence among both MWPS and non-MWPS in the same study, or any information which allowed calculation of the prevalence. We defined MWPS as heterosexual males (not men who purchase sex or individuals of other sexual orientation) who purchased sex mostly from women (and not men), or who have had sexual contact with female sex workers (FSWs). We searched Medline, Global Health, Scopus, Embase and Cinahl for articles published up until 1 March 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model to estimate the pooled HIV prevalence and the relative risk (RR) of HIV infection associated with purchasing sex. RESULTS: Of 34862 studies screened, we included 44 studies (59515 men, 47753 MWPS) from 21 countries. The pooled HIV prevalence among MWPS was 5% (95%CI: 4%-6%; I2 = 95.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled HIV prevalence calculated from studies that reported data collected pre-2001 was highest, i.e. 10% (95% CI: 6%-14%; I2 = 91.2%, p < 0.001), compared to studies whose data was collected between 2001-2010, i.e. 4% (95%CI: 2%-6%; I2 = 96.6%, p < 0.001), and from 2011 and beyond, i.e. 3% (95% CI: 2%-5%; I2 = 94.3%, p < 0.001). For studies which included comparisons of HIV infection among MWPS and non-MWPS, the relative risk of HIV infection was consistently higher among MWPS than among non-MWPS within the same study, with the overall pooled relative risk of 1.95 (95%CI: 1.56-2.44; I2 = 84.3%, p < 0.001), and 2.85 (95%CI: 1.04-7.76; I2 = 86.5%, p < 0.001) for more recent studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review represents the first comprehensive assessment of the burden of HIV among MWPS in LMICs. We found that HIV prevalence was elevated compared to the population as a whole, and that there was a strong association between purchasing sex and HIV prevalence. Despite a reduction over time in prevalence, these data highlight that MWPS need better access to HIV preventive interventions.')\n",

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the reporting of implementation outcomes of EE HIV prevention programs for AGYW in SSA, as conceptualized in the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. Methods: We searched PubMed, Ovid/MEDLINE, Science Direct, Ebscohost, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science for EE HIV interventions for AGYW in SSA. Study selection and data extraction were conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Two researchers coded each article using a validated RE-AIM data extraction tool and independently extracted information from each article. The reporting of RE-AIM dimensions were summarized and synthesized across included interventions. Results: A total of 25 unique interventions (reported in 45 articles) met the predefined eligibility criteria. Efficacy/effectiveness 19(74.4%) was the highest reported RE-AIM dimension, followed by adoption 17(67.2%), reach 16(64.0%), implementation 9(38.0%), and maintenance 7(26.4%).

Objective: Considering that half of migratory young women and girls relocating across the Latin American and Caribbean region do so without their families, increasing the likelihood of experiencing abuses, our primary objective was to test the hypothesis that Haitian FSWs in the Dominican Republic have higher odds of being physically abused by sexual partners compared to Haitian FSWs in Haiti. Methods: We conducted bivariate analyses and multivariate analyses on 2014 Hispaniola Sex Workers Study (N = 232).

Life-long treatment is required because existing drugs do not eradicate HIV-infected cells. The emergence of drug-resistant viral strains and uncertain vaccine prospects highlight the pressing need for new therapeutic approaches with the potential to clear the virus. The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef is essential for viral pathogenesis, making it a promising target for antiretroviral drug discovery. Nef enhances viral replication and promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells but lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, Nef works through diverse interactions with host cell proteins primarily related to kinase signaling pathways and endosomal trafficking. This review emphasizes the structure, function, and biological relevance of Nef interactions with host cell protein-tyrosine kinases in the broader context of Nef functions related to enhancement of the viral life cycle and immune escape. Drug discovery targeting Nef-mediated kinase activation has allowed identification of promising inhibitors of multiple Nef functions. Pharmacological inhibitors of Nef-induced MHC-I down-regulation restore the adaptive immune response to HIV-infected cells in vitro and have the potential to enhance immune recognition of latent viral reservoirs as part of a strategy for HIV clearance.')\n",

Prevalence among the country\\'s nearly 105,000 PWID is estimated to be 37.8% but has been shown to be higher in several large urban centers. A lack of public health resources, the common use of professional injectors and unsafe injection practices are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Here we evaluate the molecular characteristics of HIV-1 sequences (n = 290) from PWID in several Pakistani cities to examine transmission dynamics and the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission with regards to regional trends in opioid trafficking. Tip-to-tip (patristic) distance based phylogenetic cluster inferences and BEAST2 Bayesian phylodynamic analyses of time-stamped data were performed on HIV-1 pol sequences generated from dried blood spots collected from 1,453 PWID as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in Pakistan during 2014/2015. Overall, subtype A1 strains were dominant (75.2%) followed by CRF02_AG (14.1%), recombinants/unassigned (7.2%), CRF35_AD (2.1%), G (1.0%) and C (0.3%). Nearly three quarters of the PWID HIV-1 sequences belonged to one of five distinct phylogenetic clusters. Just below half (44.4%) of individuals in the largest cluster (n = 118) did seek help injecting from professional injectors which was previously identified as a strong correlate of HIV-1 infection. Spikes in estimated HIV-1 effective population sizes coincided with increases in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Pakistan\\'s western neighbor. Structured coalescent analysis was undertaken in order to investigate the spatial relationship of HIV-1 transmission among the various cities under study. In general terms, our analysis placed the city of Larkana at the center of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistan which is consistent with previous epidemiological data.')\n",

Knowledge of HIV status is associated with better reproductive health choices and outcomes for the infant's HIV status. We analyzed trends in known current HIV status among pregnant women attending the first antenatal care (ANC) visit in Uganda, 2012-2016. METHODS: We conducted secondary data analysis using District Health Information Software2 data on all pregnant women who came for ANC visit during 2012-2016. Women who brought documented HIV negative test result within the previous 4 weeks at the first ANC visit or an HIV positive test result and/or own HIV care card were considered as knowing their HIV status. We calculated proportions of women with known current HIV status at first ANC visit, and described linear trends both nationally and regionally. We tested statistical significance of the trend using modified Poisson regression with generalized linear models. For known HIV positive status, we only analyzed data for years 2015-2016 because this is when this data became available. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the number of women that attended first ANC visits over years 2012-2016. The proportion of women that came with known HIV status increased from 4.4% in 2012 to 6.9% in 2016 and this increase was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Most regions had an increase in trend except the West Nile and Mid-Eastern (p < 0.001). The proportion of women that came knowing their HIV positive status at first ANC visit was slightly higher than that of women that were newly tested HIV positive at first ANC visit in 2015 and 2016. CONCLUSION: Although the gap in women that come at first ANC visit without knowing their HIV positive status might be reducing, a large proportion of women who were infected with HIV did not know their status before the first ANC visit indicating a major public health gap. We recommend advocacy for early ANC attendance and hence timely HIV testing and innovations to promptly identify HIV positive women of reproductive age so that timely PMTCT interventions can be made.\")\n",

Few studies tested interventions to improve HIV outcomes among PWUD. Abstinence-reinforcing contingency management (CM) reduces drug use and could also improve HIV outcomes. METHODS: From 2012-2017, we conducted a randomized controlled trial testing whether a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention improved HIV viral load (VL) among HIV-infected adults using opioids or cocaine. In the CM intervention, drug-free urines led to escalating value of vouchers ($2.50-$80/voucher, $1320 total maximum). In intention-to-treat mixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses, we examined whether the CM intervention improved log10 VL (primary outcome), abstinence and antiretroviral adherence (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants were randomized to the CM intervention and 36 to control. Median age was 49.2 years; most were male (61.6%) and non-Hispanic black (46.6%). In CM (vs. control) participants, mean reduction in log10 VL was greater (-0.16 log10 VL copies/mL per 4-week period; 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.03, p < 0.05). Over 16 weeks, CM participants had a mean reduction of 0.64 copies/mL in log10 VL greater than control participants. The CM intervention was not significantly associated with abstinence or adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate improvements in HIV VL via an abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention. Because the CM intervention did not significantly affect abstinence or adherence, the mechanism of its effect is unclear. To end the HIV epidemic, innovative strategies must address individuals with poor HIV outcomes. Abstinence-reinforcing CM may be one potential strategy to improve HIV outcomes among a select group of PWUD.')\n",

The epithelial surface of the GI tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiota, which is considered an \"organ\" with distinctive endocrine and immunoregulatory functions. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota composition, termed dysbiosis, has been associated with epithelial damage and translocation of microbial products into the circulating blood. Dysbiosis, increased gut permeability and chronic inflammation play a major role on the clinical outcome of inflammatory bowel diseases, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and HIV infection. In this review, we focus on GVHD and HIV infection, conditions sharing gut immune damage leading to dysbiosis. The degree of dysbiosis and level of epithelial gut damage predict poor clinical outcome in both conditions. Emerging interventions are therefore warranted to promote gut microbiota homeostasis and improve intestinal barrier function. Interventions such as anti-inflammatory medications, and probiotics have toxicity and/or limited transitory effects, justifying innovative approaches. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is one such approach where fecal microorganisms are transferred from healthy donors into the GI tract of the recipient to restore microbiota composition in patients with Clostridium difficile-induced colitis or inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary findings point toward a beneficial effect of FMT to improve GVHD and HIV-related outcomes through the engraftment of beneficial donor bacteria, notably those producing anti-inflammatory metabolites. Herein, we critically review the potential for FMT in alleviating dysbiosis and gut damage in patients with GVHD or HIV-infection. Understanding the underlying mechanism by which FMT restores gut function will pave the way toward novel scalable and targeted interventions.')\n",

We evaluated HIV status disclosure to sexual partners, HIV treatment outcomes, and stigma patterns of MSM and TGW in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Previously-diagnosed MSM and TGW living with HIV who enrolled in the TRUST/RV368 cohort from March 2013 to August 2018 were asked, \"Have you told your (male/female) sexual partners (MSP/FSP) that you are living with HIV?\" In separate analyses, robust Poisson regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for characteristics associated with HIV status disclosure to MSP and FSP. Self-reported stigma indicators were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of 493 participants living with HIV, 153 (31.0%) had disclosed their HIV status to some or all MSP since being diagnosed. Among 222 with FSP, 34 (15.3%) had disclosed to some or all FSP. Factors independently associated with disclosure to MSP included living in Lagos (RR 1.58 [95% CI 1.14-2.20]) and having viral load < 50 copies/mL (RR 1.67 [95% CI 1.24-2.25]). Disclosure to FSP was more common among participants who were working in entertainment industries (RR 6.25 [95% CI 1.06-36.84]) or as drivers/laborers (RR 6.66 [95% CI 1.10-40.36], as compared to unemployed) and also among those married/cohabiting (RR 3.95 [95% CI 1.97-7.91], as compared to single) and prescribed ART (RR 2.27 [95% CI 1.07-4.83]). No differences in self-reported stigma indicators were observed by disclosure status to MSP but disclosure to FSP was associated with a lower likelihood of ever having been assaulted (26.5% versus 45.2%, p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: HIV status disclosure to sexual partners was uncommon among Nigerian MSM and TGW living with HIV but was associated with improved HIV care outcomes. Disclosure was not associated with substantially increased experiences of stigma. Strategies to encourage HIV status disclosure may improve HIV management outcomes in these highly-marginalized populations with a high burden of HIV infection.')\n",

'BACKGROUND: While there is a long history of measuring death and disability from injuries, modern research methods must account for the wide spectrum of disability that can occur in an injury, and must provide estimates with sufficient demographic, geographical and temporal detail to be useful for policy makers. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study used methods to provide highly detailed estimates of global injury burden that meet these criteria. METHODS: In this study, we report and discuss the methods used in GBD 2017 for injury morbidity and mortality burden estimation. In summary, these methods included estimating cause-specific mortality for every cause of injury, and then estimating incidence for every cause of injury. Non-fatal disability for each cause is then calculated based on the probabilities of suffering from different types of bodily injury experienced. RESULTS: GBD 2017 produced morbidity and mortality estimates for 38 causes of injury. Estimates were produced in terms of incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, cause-specific mortality, years of life lost and disability-adjusted life-years for a 28-year period for 22 age groups, 195 countries and both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: GBD 2017 demonstrated a complex and sophisticated series of analytical steps using the largest known database of morbidity and mortality data on injuries. GBD 2017 results should be used to help inform injury prevention policy making and resource allocation. We also identify important avenues for improving injury burden estimation in the future.')\n",

The framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts: 1) Susceptibility or the chance of an individual becoming infected; 2) Resistance or the ability of an individual to avoid infection; 3) Vulnerability or the likelihood of significant impacts occurring at individual, household or community level; and 4) Resilience: the active responses that enable people to avoid the worst impacts of an epidemic at different levels or to recover faster to a level accepted as normal. This framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for COVID-19: factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible; broader socio-economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility; factors that make farm households, food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic; and aspects of COVID-19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability.

However, repeat testing can be challenging in busy, under-staffed clinical settings, which could negatively impact PrEP uptake and continuation. We prospectively evaluated optional facility-based HIV self-testing (HIVST) among young women using PrEP in an implementation programme. METHODS: Between February and November 2019, we collected data from young women receiving PrEP at two family planning facilities in Kisumu, Kenya. At each PrEP follow-up visit, women were given the option to choose between provider-initiated testing and HIVST. We assessed factors associated with HIVST uptake and compared satisfaction with HIV testing and clinic experience between acceptors and decliners of HIVST. RESULTS: A total of 172 women were offered HIVST at 202 PrEP follow-up visits. The median age was 21 years, 27% had multiple partners and 15% reported previously using HIVST. HIVST was accepted at 34.7% (70/202) of visits. Age (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.09 per year, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.01 to 1.18), never being married (aRR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.95) and having more PrEP follow-up visits (aRR 1.13 per visit, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23) were associated with HIVST uptake. Compared to HIVST decliners, HIVST acceptors were more likely to be very happy with their overall testing experience (73% vs. 47% of visits, p = 0.003) and were more likely to say they would use HIVST in the future (96% vs. 76%, p < 0.001). Women who accepted HIVST had shorter visits than those choosing standard provider-initiated HIV testing (median [IQR]: 33 [32, 38] vs. 54 [41.5, 81] minutes, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot evaluation in Kenya, about one-third of women using PrEP opted for HIVST over provider-initiated testing, and those choosing HIVST spent less time in the clinic and were generally satisfied with their experience. HIVST in PrEP delivery is feasible and has the potential to simplify PrEP delivery and give clients testing autonomy.

Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.\")\n",

Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS, influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted subjects. METHODS: We developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed. RESULTS: We successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus, though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from muco-positive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no symptoms, and negative molecular and/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5-10 minutes, and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10). IMPLICATIONS: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization/delivery. These data reinforce the importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against COVID-19.')\n",

For the caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) LHIV and not on ART, attempts to identify them and ensure that they initiate and continue using ART is critical for their wellbeing and their ability to care for their children. METHODS: Data are from the community-based, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kizazi Kipya project that aims at scaling up the uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services by orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and their caregivers. HIV positive caregivers of OVC who were enrolled in the USAID Kizazi Kipya project between January 2017 and June 2018 were included in this cross-sectional study. The caregivers were drawn from 11 regions: Arusha, Iringa, Katavi, Kigoma, Mara, Mbeya, Morogoro, Ruvuma, Simiyu, Singida, and Tanga. The outcome variable was ART status (either using or not), which was enquired of each OVC caregiver LHIV at enrollment. Data analysis involved multivariable analysis using random-effects logistic regression to identify correlates of ART use. RESULTS: In total, 74,999 caregivers living with HIV with mean age of 44.4 years were analyzed. Of these, 96.4% were currently on ART at enrollment. In the multivariable analysis, ART use was 30% lower in urban than in rural areas (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.81). Food security improved the odds of being on ART (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.15-1.45). Disabled caregivers were 42% less likely than non-disabled ones to be on ART (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.76). Male caregivers with health insurance were 43% more likely than uninsured male caregivers to be on ART (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.83). Caregivers aged 40-49 years had 18% higher likelihood of being on ART than the youngest ones. Primary education level was associated with 26% increased odds of being on ART than no education (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41). CONCLUSIONS: Although nearly all the caregivers LHIV in the current study were on ART (96.4%), more efforts are needed to achieve universal coverage. The unreached segments of the population LHIV, even if small, may lead to worse health outcomes, and also spur further spread of the HIV epidemic due to unachieved viral suppression.

Data and Methods: Data are from a community-based, USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project that aims at increasing the uptake of HIV services, as well as other health and social services by OVC and their caregivers in Tanzania. Caregivers who were enrolled in the project from January to July 2017 in seven regions of Tanzania, and had reported their HIV status to the project, were included in the analysis. While HIV status was the outcome, the main independent variable was food insufficiency which was assessed using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS). Using Stata (version 14.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), data analysis involved multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression.. Results: Of the 47,617 caregivers analyzed (73.7% females), 61.8% and 4.6% were experiencing moderate and severe hunger, respectively. The overall HIV prevalence among the caregivers was 28.3%. Nevertheless, the prevalence was as high as 34.2% among caregivers in severe hunger households. Multivariate analysis revealed an increasing likelihood of being HIV positive as hunger increased (moderate hunger: OR=1.10, 95%CI: 1.03-1.18; severe hunger: OR=1.51, 95%CI: 1.32-1.74). These observations were adjusted for marital status, age, sex, education, place of residence, family size, disability status, and health insurance. Conclusion: Food insufficiency is associated with a higher likelihood of HIV infection among OVC caregivers in Tanzania, suggesting that improving access to adequate food has a potential to reduce HIV risks among them.

RESULTS: A total of 1,198 participants were enrolled, 1,046 (87.3%) at home and 152 (12.7%) at mobile events. Most participants (928, 77.5%) chose staff-aided testing either at home or at a mobile event; 268 (22.4%) chose self-testing; and only 2 (.2%) chose facility referral. Prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV-positives was 2.7% (32/1,198) and 36.8% (429/1,166) of HIV-negative AGYW were identified as high risk. We identified more newly diagnosed HIV infection among AGYW recruited at mobile events than at home (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.33-6.74; p = .02). High-risk status was related to neither recruitment strategy nor testing modality. Older age was associated with increased odds of selecting an oral self-test (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.06-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of AGYW were at elevated risk of HIV infection, and those unaware of their HIV infection were more likely to be identified at a mobile outreach. Though self-testing was not the dominant preferred strategy, self-tests were performed accurately and with high confidence. These findings can help inform efficient identification of undiagnosed HIV infection and high risk for seroconversion among AGYW in similar settings.')\n",

Due to unique pharmacokinetic characteristics, treatment with TAF is not associated with significant renal proximal tubular accumulation of TFV. TAF is associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and renal proximal tubular dysfunction than treatment with TDF. No cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported in clinical trials of TAF. It is unknown whether treatment with TAF can lead to accumulation of TFV in proximal tubular cells and cause nephrotoxicity under certain clinical circumstances. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a patient on stable TAF-based antiretroviral therapy with for HIV-1 infection who developed proximal tubulopathy when treated with gentamicin for febrile neutropenia in the context of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighteen days after commencing chemotherapy for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma the patient presented to hospital with fevers, hypotension and neutropenia. The patient was commenced on piperacillin, tazobactam and gentamicin. Within 24 h the patient developed marked hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia requiring intravenous replacement therapy. There was proteinuria, glycosuria and evidence of marked urinary electrolyte wasting, consistent with acute proximal tubular dysfunction. Eleven days after the gentamicin was stopped the serum biochemistry normalised. The urinary electrolyte wasting and proteinuria had improved, and the glycosuria had resolved. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report to describe acute renal proximal tubulopathy in an HIV-infected patient treated with TAF and gentamicin. As the number of patients prescribed TAF outside the clinical trial setting increases, so too does the potential for previously unreported drug interactions and adverse events. Clinicians need to be aware of potential unreported adverse drug reactions as the use of TAF becomes increasingly common in clinical practice.')\n",

We investigated the costs and efficiency of HIV services in relation to HIV testing yield in rural Karonga District, Malawi. METHODS: Costs of HIV services were measured over 12 months to September 2017 in five health facilities, drawing on recognised health costing principles. Financial and economic costs were collected in Malawi Kwacha and United States Dollars (US$). Costs were calculated using a provider perspective to estimate average annual costs (2017 US$) per HIV testing episode, per HIV-positive case diagnosed, and per patient-year on antiretroviral therapy (ART), by facility. Costs were assessed in relation to scale of operation and facility-level annual HIV positivity rate. A one-way sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand how staffing levels and the HIV positivity rate affected HIV testing costs. RESULTS: HIV testing episodes per day and per full-time equivalent HIV health worker averaged 3.3 (range 2.0 to 5.7). The HIV positivity rate averaged 2.4% (range 1.9 to 3.7%). The average cost per testing episode was US$2.85 (range US$1.95 to US$8.55), and the average cost per HIV diagnosis was US$116.35 (range US$77.42 to US$234.11), with the highest costs found in facilities with the lowest daily number of tests and lowest HIV yield respectively. The mean facility-level cost per patient-year on ART was approximately US$100 (range US$90.67 to US$115.42). ART drugs were the largest cost component averaging 71% (range 55 to 76%). The cost per patient-year of viral load tests averaged US$4.50 (range US$0.52 to US$7.00) with cost variation reflecting differences in the tests to ART patient ratio across facilities. CONCLUSION: Greater efficiencies in HIV service delivery are possible in Karonga through increasing daily testing episodes among existing health workers or allocating health workers to tasks in addition to testing. Costs per diagnosis will increase as yields decline, and therefore, encouraging targeted testing strategies that increase yield will be more efficient. Given the contribution of drug costs to per patient-year treatment costs, it is critical to preserve the life-span of first-line ART regimens, underlining the need for continuing adherence support and regular viral load monitoring.')\n",

A comparative modeling study.\", \"['Bromberg, Daniel J', 'Paltiel, A David', 'Busch, Susan H', 'Pachankis, John E']\", '2021 Feb', \"BACKGROUND: While advances in HIV prevention and treatment have changed the epidemic for gay and bisexual men, another epidemic faces this population. Gay and bisexual men represent one of the highest risk groups for depression, which potentially poses quality-of-life and public health challenges comparable to those of HIV. The present study seeks to inform comprehensive care for sexual minority men by estimating and comparing the morbidity of HIV and depression for US gay and bisexual men. METHODS: In 2018, weighted counts of gay and bisexual men living with HIV and depression were derived from the CDC's Medical Monitoring Project and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, respectively. Years lived with disability for HIV and depression were calculated using the Global Burden of Disease Study's disability weights. FINDINGS: Among gay and bisexual adult men in the US, the prevalence of past-year major depressive episodes is 14.17%, while the prevalence of HIV is 11.52%. We estimate that in calendar year 2015, major depressive episodes imposed 85,361 (95% CI 58,293-112,212) years lived with disability among US adult gay and bisexual men, whereas HIV posed 42,981 (95% CI 36,221-49,722) years lived with disability. INTERPRETATION: This analysis shows that depression morbidity currently exceeds that for HIV among US adult gay and bisexual men. While gay and bisexual men are frequently understood to be a high-risk population for HIV, including in guidelines for HIV prevention and treatment, the present analysis suggests that this population should also be considered high-risk for depression.\")\n",

Adherence to TB therapy is an important factor in treatment outcomes, which is a critical indicator for evaluating TB treatment programs. This study assessed TB treatment outcomes using a fifteen-year record of tuberculosis patients who received treatment in Jos-North and Mangu Local Government Areas of Plateau State, North-Central Nigeria. METHODS: The retrospective facility based study was done in five TB treatment centers which account for more than half of data for tuberculosis patients in Plateau State. Data were collected from 10,156 TB patient's health records between 2001 and 2015. Treatment outcomes were categorized as successful (cured, treatment completed) or unsuccessful (non-adherent, treatment failure or death). A descriptive analysis was done to assess the factors associated with treatment outcomes. Relevant bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were done. All statistical analyses were performed on Stata version 11, College station, Texas, USA. RESULTS: During the study period, 58.1% (5904/10156) of the TB patients who received treatment were males. The Mean age +/- SD was 35.5 +/- 15.5 years. The overall treatment success rate was 67.4%; non-adherence/defaulting rate was 18.5%, with majority of patients defaulting at the end of intensive phase of treatment. The sputum conversion rate was 72.8% and mortality rate was 7.5%. A decrease in successful treatment outcomes rate from 83.8% in 2001 to 64.4% in 2015 was observed.

Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex.

Data were coded inductively and analysed thematically. Participants reported benefits of couple testing during antenatal care, including facilitated HIV status disclosure and mutual support for HIV care-seeking. However, unintended consequences included women attending without partners, being refused or delayed access to antenatal services. Some women were required to obtain letters from village leaders to justify the absence of their partners, again to delaying or disrupting care-seeking. When partners attended antenatal care, consultations were reportedly more likely to focus on HIV testing, and less on antenatal or neonatal care. Strategies to increase men's attendance at HIV clinics with their partners can promote mutual support within couples for HIV care engagement, but may risk undermining engagement in pregnancy and HIV care for some women if over-stringently applied.

In at least three specific viruses, this approach has had met with preliminary success. In rhinovirus and poliovirus, compounds like pleconaril bind capsid and block RNA release.

However, knockout cells lacking inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK-KO), the enzyme that produces IP6 by phosphorylation of inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), were still able to produce infectious HIV-1 particles at a greatly reduced rate. HIV-1 in vitro assembly can also be stimulated to a lesser extent with IP5, but until recently, it was not known if IP5 could also function in promoting assembly in vivo. Here we addressed whether there is an absolute requirement for IP6 or IP5 in the production of infectious HIV-1 particles. IPPK-KO cells expressed no detectable IP6 but elevated IP5 levels and displayed a 20-100-fold reduction in infectious particle production, correlating with lost virus release. Transient transfection of an IPPK expression vector stimulated infectious particle production and release in IPPK-KO but not wildtype cells. Several attempts to make IP6/IP5 deficient stable cells were not successful, but transient expression of the enzyme multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-1 (MINPP1) into IPPK-KOs resulted in near ablation of IP6 and IP5. Under these conditions, we found that HIV-1 infectious particle production and virus release were essentially abolished (1000-fold reduction) demonstrating an IP6/IP5 requirement. However, other retroviruses including a Gammaretrovirus, a Betaretrovirus, and two non-primate Lentiviruses displayed only a modest (3-fold) reduction in infectious particle production from IPPK-KOs and were not significantly altered by expression of IPPK or MINPP1. The only other retrovirus found to show a clear IP6/IP5 dependence was the primate (macaque) Lentivirus Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, which displayed similar sensitivity as HIV-1. We were not able to determine if producer cell IP6/IP5 is required at additional steps beyond assembly because viral particles devoid of both molecules could not be generated.

Consistent condom use during paid sex is essential for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and predictors of consistent condom use among men who pay for sex in sub-Saharan Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We pooled data from 29 sub-Saharan African countries' Demographic and Health Surveys. A total of 3,353 men in sub-Saharan Africa who had paid for sex in the last 12 months preceding the surveys and had complete information on all the variables of interest were used in this study. The outcome variable for the study was consistent condom use for every paid sex in the last 12 months. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out. Results were presented as adjusted odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was declared at p< 0.05. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of consistent condom use during paid sex in sub-Saharan Africa was 83.96% (CI = 80.35-87.56), ranging from 48.70% in Benin to 98% in Burkina Faso.

Outcomes are generally worse among youth of color. Experiences of discrimination and marginalization often limit educational attainment and may even more directly limit access to gainful employment. Though seemingly distal, these experiences influence young people's proximity to HIV risk by limiting their access to health care and potentially moving them toward sex work as a means of income as well as increased substance use. Work2Prevent (W2P) aims to achieve economic stability through employment as a structural-level intervention for preventing adolescent and young adult HIV infection. The study will pilot-test an effective, theoretically driven employment program (increased individual income and independence [iFOUR]), for HIV-positive adults, and adapt it to the needs of black and Latinx YMSM, YTW, and GNC youth aged 16 to 24 years who are vulnerable to HIV exposure.

We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. FINDINGS: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 1.63 times (median across models; range 1.39-1.87) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296 000 (range 229 023-420 000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1.6 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 1.06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 1.19 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). INTERPRETATION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.')\n",

To determine the association of maternal HIV infection with maternal and newborn innate immunity we analyzed the cytokine responses upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) stimulations in the triad of maternal peripheral and placental blood as well as in cord blood in a cohort of mother-infant pairs from southern Mozambique. A total of 48 women (35 HIV-uninfected and 13 HIV-infected) were included. Women and infant innate responses positively correlated with each other. Age, gravidity and sex of the fetus had some associations with spontaneous production of cytokines in the maternal peripheral blood. HIV-infected women not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) before pregnancy showed decreased IL-8 and IL-6 PRR responses in peripheral blood compared to those HIV-uninfected, and PRR hyporesponsiveness for IL-8 was also found in the corresponding infant's cord blood. HIV infection had a greater impact on placental blood responses, with significantly increased pro-inflammatory, T H 1 and T H 17 PRR responses in HIV-infected women not receiving ART before pregnancy compared to HIV-uninfected women. In conclusion, innate response of the mother and her newborn was altered by HIV infection in the women who did not receive ART before pregnancy. As these responses could be related to birth outcomes, targeted innate immune modulation could improve maternal and newborn health.\")\n",

Methods: Data are from the USAID Kizazi Kipya project that aims to increase the uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services by OVC and their caregivers. HIV-positive OVC aged 0-14 years who were enrolled in the project from January 2017 to September 2018 were analyzed. ART status (off ART or on ART) was the outcome variable. Multivariate analysis was performed using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Of the 10,047 HIV-positive OVC aged 0-14 years analyzed, 93.5% were currently on ART at enrollment. In the multivariate analysis, OVC with male caregivers were 4-times more likely than those with female caregivers to be on ART (OR=4.03, 95% CI=1.49-10.90). OVC with HIV-positive caregivers were 12-times more likely than those with HIV-negative caregivers to be on ART (OR=12.0, 95% CI=3.81-37.70).

This study aims to identify patterns of ecstasy use among live music event attendees; explore the opinions and potential usage of illicit pill testing programs and examine factors associated with the likelihood of still taking a pill containing a potential harmful substance. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 760 people attending a major Australian live music event in 2017. RESULTS: The most commonly used drug in the last 12 months was ecstasy (73.9%). About 5% of people who use drugs had sought medical attention due to consumption of ecstasy. People who use drugs agreed \"a lot\" that pill testing should be provided for free at live music events (82.2%) and that it should be combined with harm reduction advice (62.9%). Additionally, 32% of all participants agreed \\'a lot\\' that they would be more likely to take illicit drugs at a music festival if pill-testing services were present. However, if people perceived that a harmful substance was detected in their drugs after using a pill testing service, 52.3% of people who have used illicit drugs reported that they would \\'not at all\\' be likely to still consume the drug. They also reported that they would still take a pill if testing demonstrated the presence of unintended MDMA-type substances (70.3%), amphetamines (31.2%) or ketamine (27.8%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that only increased frequency of ecstasy use was significantly associated with taking a pill despite pill testing services detecting a harmful substance. Gender, age, alcohol and previously seeking ecstasy-related medical attention were not associated in the multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of live music attendees consume alcohol and ecstasy. Both people who have and who have not used illicit drugs support the implementation of pill testing services.

Syndemic theory holds that psychosocial issues co-occur and interact, and thus increase sexual risk behaviour. Psychosocial issue identification, referral and management might reduce risk behaviour. METHODS: In the syndemic-based intervention study, an open-label randomised controlled trial, MSM were enrolled at the STI outpatient clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam. We screened participants using validated questionnaires on the following problem domains: alcohol and substance use, sexual compulsivity, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alexithymia, intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse. Individuals were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tailored, face-to-face feedback and help-seeking advice on mental health screening, or no feedback and no help-seeking advice.

The state health department undertook participatory simulation modeling to develop a baseline for comparing epidemic trends and feedback on ETE strategies. METHODS: A dynamic compartmental model projected the individual and combined effects of 3 ETE initiatives: enhanced linkage to and retention in HIV treatment, increased preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among men who have sex with men, and expanded housing assistance. Data inputs for model calibration and low-, medium-, and high-implementation scenarios (stakeholders' rollout predictions, and lower and upper bounds) came from surveillance and program data through 2014, the literature, and expert judgment. RESULTS: Without ETE (baseline scenario), new HIV infections would decline but remain >750, and HIV prevalence would continue to increase by 2020. Concurrently implementing the 3 programs would lower annual new HIV infections by 16.0%, 28.1%, and 45.7% compared with baseline in the low-, medium-, and high-implementation scenarios, respectively. In all concurrent implementation scenarios, although annual new HIV infections would remain >750, there would be fewer new HIV infections than deaths, yielding the first-ever decrease in HIV prevalence. PrEP and enhanced linkage and retention would confer the largest population-level changes. CONCLUSIONS: New York State will achieve 1 ETE benchmark under the most realistic (medium) implementation scenario.

It is important to determine the performance of such systems in specific patient populations. We aimed to validate and determine within-day reliability of an IMU system for measuring lower limb gait kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters (TSP) in people with and without HIV. METHODS: Gait was recorded in eight adults with HIV (PLHIV) and eight HIV-seronegative participants (SNP), using IMUs and optical motion capture (OMC) simultaneously. Participants performed six gait trials. Fifteen TSP and 28 kinematic angles were extracted. Intraclass correlations (ICC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess concurrent validity of the IMU system (relative to OMC) separately in PLHIV and SNP. IMU reliability was assessed during within-session retest of trials. ICCs were used to assess relative reliability. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage SEM were used to assess absolute reliability. RESULTS: Between-system TSP differences demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent ICCs (0.71-0.99), except for double support time and temporophasic parameters (< 0.60). All TSP demonstrated good mean absolute percentage errors (</=7.40%). For kinematics, ICCs were acceptable to excellent (0.75-1.00) for all but three range of motion (ROM) and four discrete angles. RMSE and bias were 0.0 degrees -4.7 degrees for all but two ROM and 10 discrete angles. In both groups, TSP reliability was acceptable to excellent for relative (ICC 0.75-0.99) (except for one temporal and two temporophasic parameters) and absolute (%SEM 1.58-15.23) values. Reliability trends of IMU-measured kinematics were similar between groups and demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent relative reliability (ICC 0.76-0.99) and clinically acceptable absolute reliability (SEM 0.7 degrees -4.4 degrees ) for all but two and three discrete angles, respectively.

However, the limit of detection (LOD) of lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), the most prominent POC diagnostic platform, falls short of that of laboratory protein detection methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Here, we report the development and optimization of a thermal contrast amplification (TCA) LFA that will allow ultrasensitive detection of 8 pg/ml p24 protein spiked into human serum at POC, approaching the LOD of a laboratory test. To achieve this aim, we pursued several innovations as follows: (a) defining a new quantitative figure of merit for LFA design based on the specific to nonspecific binding ratio (BR); (b) using different sizes and shapes of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in the systematic optimization of TCA LFA designs; and (c) exploring new laser wavelengths and power regimes for TCA LFA designs. First, we optimized the blocking buffer for the membrane and running buffer by quantitatively measuring the BR using a TCA reader. The TCA reader interprets the thermal signal (i.e., temperature) of GNPs within the membrane when irradiated by a laser at the plasmon resonance wavelength of the particle. This process results in higher detection and quantitation of GNPs than in traditional visual detection (i.e., color intensity). Further, we investigated the effect of laser power (30, 100, 200 mW), GNP size and shape (30 and 100 nm gold spheres, 150 nm gold-silica shells), and laser wavelength (532, 800 nm). Applying these innovations to a new TCA LFA design, we demonstrated that 100 nm spheres with a 100 mW 532 nm laser provided the best performance (i.e., LOD = 8 pg/ml). This LOD is significantly better than that of the current colorimetric LFA and is in the range of the laboratory-based p24 ELISA.

We investigated willingness to use a single oral pill before or after sex among men who have sex with men (MSM) and assessed the biological efficacy of a potent antiretroviral combination containing elvitegravir (EVG), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). METHODS: Data on willingness to use single-dose PrEP or PEP were obtained from the 2017 cycle of the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), an annual online behavioral surveillance survey of MSM in the United States. Antiretroviral drug levels were measured in humans and macaques to define drug distribution in rectal tissue and identify clinically relevant doses for macaque modeling studies. The biological efficacy of a single dose of FTC/TAF/EVG as PrEP or PEP was investigated using a repeat-challenge macaque model of rectal HIV infection. FINDINGS: Through pharmacokinetic assessment in humans and macaques we found that EVG penetrates and concentrates in rectal tissues supporting its addition to FTC/TAF to boost and extend chemoprophylactic activity. Efficacy estimates for a single oral dose given to macaques 4h before or 2h after SHIV exposure was 91*7%[35*7%-98*9%] and 100%, respectively, compared to 80*1%[13*9%-95*4%] and 64*6%[-19*4%-89*5%] when single doses were given 6 and 24h post challenge, respectively. A two-dose regimen at 24h and 48h after exposure was also protective [77*1%[1*7%-94*7%]. INTERPRETATION: Informed by user willingness, human and macaque pharmacokinetic data, and preclinical efficacy we show that single-dose prophylaxis before or after sex is a promising HIV prevention strategy. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to determine if any of these strategies will be effective in humans.

While KSHV is clearly the etiologic agent of KS, the mechanisms underlying KS development are not fully understood. For example, HIV-1 co-infection and concomitant immune dysfunction have been associated with EpKS development. However, the direct or indirect role(s) of HIV-1, and therefore of immune suppression, in EpKS remains unclear. How, or whether, EpKS is mechanistically distinct from EnKS is unknown. Thus, the absence of HIV-1 co-infection in EnKS provides a unique control for investigating and deciphering whether HIV-1 plays a direct or indirect role in the EpKS tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that HIV-1 co-infection would induce transcriptome changes that differentiate EpKS from EnKS, thereby defining the direct intra-tumor role of HIV-1 in KS. Comparison of ART-treated and -naive patients would further define the impact of ART on the KS transcriptome. We utilized RNA-seq followed by multiparameter bioinformatics analysis to compare transcriptomes from KS lesions to uninvolved control skin. We provide the first transcriptomic comparison of EpKS versus EnKS, ART-treated vs-naive EpKS and male vs female EpKS to define the roles of HIV-1 co-infection, the impact of ART, and gender on KS gene expression profiles. Our findings suggest that ART-use and gender have minimal impact on transcriptome profiles of KS lesions. Gene expression profiles strongly correlated between EpKS and EnKS patients (Spearman r = 0.83, p<10-10). A subset of genes involved in tumorigenesis and inflammation/immune responses showed higher magnitude, but not unique dysregulation in EnKS compared to EpKS. While gender and ART had no detectable contribution, the trend toward higher magnitude of gene dysregulation in EnKS coupled with the absence of HIV-1 transcripts in EpKS may suggest an indirect or systemic effect of HIV-1 to promote KS tumorigenesis.\")\n",

However, they have been underused in US minority settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using text message surveys. METHODS: We conducted a single-group study with 17 African-American young adults, aged 18-24 years, who were economically disadvantaged and reported prior unprotected sex. Participants received a text message survey once each week for 5 weeks. The survey contained 14 questions with yes-no and numeric responses on sexual risk behaviors (ie, condomless sex, sex while high or drunk, and sex exchange) and economic behaviors (ie, income, employment, and money spent on HIV services or products). Feasibility measures were the number of participants who responded to the survey in a given week, the number of questions to which a participant responded in each survey, and the number of hours spent from sending a survey to participants to receiving their response in a given week. One discussion group was used to obtain feedback. RESULTS: Overall, 65% (n=11/17) of the participants responded to at least one text message survey compared with 35% (n=6/17) of the participants who did not respond. The majority (n=7/11, 64%) of the responders were women. The majority (n=4/6, 67%) of nonresponders were men. An average of 7.6 participants (69%) responded in a given week. Response rates among ever responders ranged from 64% to 82% across the study period. The mean number of questions answered each week was 12.6 (SD 2.7; 90% of all questions), ranging from 72% to 100%. An average of 6.4 participants (84%) answered all 14 text message questions in a given week, ranging from 57% to 100%. Participants responded approximately 8.7 hours (SD 10.3) after receiving the survey. Participants were more likely to answer questions related to employment, condomless sex, and discussions with sex partners. Nonresponse or skip was more often used for questions at the end of the survey relating to sex exchange and money spent on HIV prevention services or products. Strengths of the text message survey were convenience, readability, short completion time, having repeated measures over time, and having incentives.

In a study in Cape Town, South Africa, 586 women living without and 535 living with HIV, aged 30-65 years, were recruited. Each woman underwent a pelvic exam to collect cervical samples (tested by LA and GX for 14 high-risk HPV genotypes) and underwent colposcopy with histological sampling to determine CIN2+.

We aimed to estimate temporal trends in HCV seroprevalence between 2005 and 2018 among Montreal MSM, and to identify socioeconomic, behavioural and biological factors associated with HCV exposure among this population. METHODS: We used data from three cross-sectional surveys conducted among Montreal MSM in 2005 (n=1795), 2009 (n=1258) and 2018 (n=1086). To ensure comparability of seroprevalence estimates across time, we standardised the 2005 and 2009 time-location samples to the 2018 respondent-driven sample. Time trends overall and stratified by HIV status, history of injection drug use (IDU) and age were examined. Modified Poisson regression analyses with generalised estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with HCV seropositivity pooling all surveys. RESULTS: Standardised HCV seroprevalence among all MSM remained stable from 7% (95% CI 3% to 10%) in 2005, to 8% (95% CI 1% to 9%) in 2009 and 8% (95% CI 4% to 11%) in 2018. This apparent stability hides diverging temporal trends in seroprevalence between age groups, with a decrease among MSM <30 years old and an increase among MSM aged >/=45 years old. Lifetime IDU was the strongest predictor of HCV seropositivity, and no association was found between HCV seroprevalence and sexual risk factors studied (condomless anal sex with men of serodiscordant/unknown HIV status, number of sexual partners, group sex). CONCLUSIONS: HCV seroprevalence remained stable among Montreal MSM between 2005 and 2018. Unlike other settings where HCV infection was strongly associated with sexual risk factors among MSM, IDU was the pre-eminent risk factor for HCV seropositivity. Understanding the intersection of IDU contexts, practices and populations is essential to prevent HCV transmission among MSM.')\n",

This study extended from that initial work to test the cancer-related clinical impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on opioid antinociception in cancer-induced bone pain in female BALB/c mice and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in male and female CD-1 mice. Mice were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors (17-AAG, KU-32) by the intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, or intraperitoneal routes, and after 24 hours, pain behaviors were evaluated after analgesic drug treatment. Heat shock protein 90 inhibition in the brain or systemically completely blocked morphine and oxymorphone antinociception in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; this effect was partly mediated by decreased ERK and JNK MAPK activation and by increased protein translation, was not altered by chronic treatment, and Hsp90 inhibition had no effect on gabapentin antinociception. We also found that the Hsp90 isoform Hsp90alpha and the cochaperone Cdc37 were responsible for the observed changes in opioid antinociception. By contrast, Hsp90 inhibition in the spinal cord or systemically partially reduced opioid antinociception in cancer-induced bone pain.

Here, we formally test the role of effector function in vivo by comparing the rate and timing of plasma-virus clearance in response to a single-dose treatment with either unmodified NAb or those with either reduced or augmented Fc function. When infused into viremic simian HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, there was a 21% difference in slope of plasma-virus decline between NAb and NAb with reduced Fc function. NAb engineered to increase FcgammaRIII binding and improve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro resulted in arming of effector cells in vivo, yet led to viral-decay kinetics similar to NAbs with reduced Fc function. These studies show that the predominant mechanism of antiviral activity of HIV NAbs is through inhibition of viral entry, but that Fc function can contribute to the overall antiviral activity, making them distinct from standard ARVs.')\n",

It uses multiplex digital droplet PCR to distinguish and separately quantify intact proviruses, defined by a lack of overt fatal defects such as large deletions and APOBEC3G-mediated hypermutation, from the majority of proviruses that have such defects. This distinction is important because only intact proviruses cause viral rebound on ART interruption. To evaluate IPDA performance and provide benchmark data to support its implementation, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 400 HIV-1(+) adults on ART from several diverse cohorts, representing a robust sample of treated HIV-1 infection in the United States. We provide direct quantitative evidence that defective proviruses greatly outnumber intact proviruses (by >12.5 fold). However, intact proviruses are present at substantially higher frequencies (median, 54/10(6) CD4(+) T cells) than proviruses detected by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay, which requires induction and in vitro growth ( approximately 1/10(6) CD4(+) T cells). IPDA amplicon signal issues resulting from sequence polymorphisms were observed in only 6.3% of individuals and were readily apparent and easily distinguished from low proviral frequency, an advantage of the IPDA over standard PCR assays which generate false-negative results in such situations.

Although disclosure to sexual partners, family members or friends has been extensively studied, disclosure to community-based HIV programs is missing. This study assesses the magnitude of, and factors associated with undisclosed HIV status to a community-based HIV prevention program among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Tanzania. METHODS: Data are from the USAID-funded Kizazi Kipya project that seeks to increase uptake of HIV, health, and social services by OVC and their caregivers in Tanzania. Data on OVC caregivers who were enrolled in the project during January-March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania were analyzed. Caregivers included were those who had complete information on their HIV status disclosure, household socioeconomic status, and sociodemographic characteristics. HIV status was self-reported, with undisclosed status representing all those who knew their HIV status but did not disclose it. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, with caregivers' HIV status disclosure being the outcome variable was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis was based on 59,683 OVC caregivers (mean age = 50.4 years), 71.2% of whom were female. Of these, 37.2% did not disclose their HIV status to the USAID Kizazi Kipya program at the time of enrollment. Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of HIV status non-disclosure was significantly higher among: male caregivers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.28); unmarried (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23); widowed (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18); those without health insurance (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.28-1.45); age 61 + years (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.59-1.88); those with physical or mental disability (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25); and rural residents (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34-1.86). HIV status non-disclosure was less likely with higher education (p < 0.001); and with better economic status (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While improved education, economic strengthening support and expanding health insurance coverage appear to improve HIV status disclosure, greater attention may be required for men, unmarried, widowed, rural residents, and the elderly populations for their higher likelihood to conceal HIV status.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3.0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

Among these, epilepsy is of key concern because of its lifelong impact and potential for damage to the central nervous system (CNS). Few studies in developing regions have investigated the prevalence and aetiology of epilepsy in HIV-infected children as a key population. Objectives: We describe the prevalence of epilepsy, associated neurological disabilities, immunological status, clinical stage and history of CNS infection at epilepsy diagnosis in a cohort of HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study (2004-2014) at two major referral sites for HIV-infected children diagnosed with epilepsy aged 0-16 years. Eligible subjects were extracted from the electronic medicine bridging access to care in excellence (EMBRACE) Paediatric Cohort using the Paediatric ART Data Management Tool (PADMT). Fixed data fields were interrogated for exposures to antiepileptic drugs. Unstructured 'comments' fields were searched for the terms: epilepsy, seizures, fits and szs, as well as abbreviated versions of common antiepileptic drug names. Eligible subject folders were then retrieved to validate the digital data. Results: From 2139 children enrolled in the two sites, 53 children were diagnosed with epilepsy (2.48%). In these, the median CD4 count was 591 cells/mm(3), and the mean viral load was 4.9 log copies/mL, with undetectable viral loads in only seven children (14.0%). World Health Organization (WHO) clinical HIV stage was available for 46 patients of the sample, with 3, 6, 26 and 11 children graded at stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Forty percent children had a history of CNS infection prior to the epilepsy diagnosis, and 55% children were reported to have school problems. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the prevalence of epilepsy among children with HIV was 2.48%, mostly diagnosed in advanced HIV-disease stages. Our findings support the usefulness of early detection and initiation of ART in HIV-infected children in order to reduce the risk of epilepsy. In addition, our study demonstrates that novel techniques are effective in accessing cohort-level data that allow interrogation of both structured and unstructured clinical data.\")\n",

Accumulating data suggest that increases in cytochrome P450 46A1 activity in mouse models of common neurodegenerative diseases affect various, apparently unlinked biological processes and pathways. Yet, the underlying reason for these multiple enzyme activity effects is currently unknown. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 46A1-mediated sterol flux alters physico-chemical properties of the plasma membranes and thereby membrane-dependent events. We used 9-month old 5XFAD mice (an Alzheimer's disease model) treated for 6 months with the anti-HIV drug efavirenz. These animals have previously been shown to have improved behavioral performance, increased cytochrome P450 46A1 activity in the brain, and increased sterol flux through the plasma membranes. We further examined 9-month old Cyp46a1 (-/-) mice, which have previously been observed to have cognitive deficits and decreased sterol flux through brain membranes. Synaptosomal fractions from the brain of efavirenz-treated 5XFAD mice had essentially unchanged cholesterol levels as compared to control 5XFAD mice. However with efavirenz treatment in these mice, there were changes in the membrane properties (increased cholesterol accessibility, ordering, osmotic resistance, and thickness) as well as total glutamate content and ability to release glutamate in response to mild stimulation. Similarly, the cholesterol content in synaptosomal fractions from the brain of Cyp46a1 (-/-) mice was essentially the same as in wild type mice but knockout of Cyp46a1 was associated with changes in membrane properties and glutamate content and its exocytotic release. Changes in Cyp46a1 (-/-) mice were in the opposite direction to those observed in efavirenz-treated vs control 5XFAD mice. Incubation of synaptosomal fractions with the inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, protein phosphatase 1/2A or calcineurin, and protein phosphatase 2B revealed that increased sterol flux in efavirenz-treated vs control 5XFAD mice affected the ability of all four enzymes to modulate glutamate release. In contrast, in Cyp46a1 (-/-) vs wild type mice, decreased sterol flux altered the ability of only cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and protein phosphatase 2B to regulate the glutamate release.

METHODS: We describe outpatient and inpatient preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic, and present a case series of all known patients with HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection at The Miriam Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital, and The Miriam Hospital Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center, in Providence, Rhode Island, US. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center rapidly prepared for outpatient and inpatient care of persons with HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

Twenty were male, six female and one transgender female; average age was 49 years; 13/27 were Hispanic and 6/27 were African American. All had HIV viral load <200 copies/mL and were on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count range 87 to 1441 cells/microL. Twenty-six of the 27 had common COVID-19 symptoms for one to twenty-eight days and most had other co-morbidities and/or risk factors.

We have previously shown that the acetylation and activation of key inflammatory regulators, NF-kappaB p65 and STAT3, were increased in HIVAN kidneys. Here, we demonstrate the key role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase in the regulation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 activity in HIVAN. We found that SIRT1 expression was reduced in the glomeruli of human and mouse HIVAN kidneys and that HIV-1 gene expression was associated with reduced SIRT1 expression and increased acetylation of NF-kappaB p65 and STAT3 in cultured podocytes. Interestingly, SIRT1 overexpression, in turn, reduced the expression of negative regulatory factor in podocytes stably expressing HIV-1 proviral genes, which was associated with inactivation of NF-kappaB p65 and a reduction in HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter activity. In vivo, the administration of the small-molecule SIRT1 agonist BF175 or inducible overexpression of SIRT1 specifically in podocytes markedly attenuated albuminuria, kidney lesions, and expression of inflammatory markers in Tg26 mice. Finally, we showed that the reduction in SIRT1 expression by HIV-1 is in part mediated through miR-34a expression.

Methods: For medical students, we developed a didactic presentation and video recording discussing (1) a brief history of HIV prevention, (2) indications for PrEP prescription, (3) medical testing for PrEP onboarding, (4) common PrEP side effects, and (5) appropriate follow-up and testing for PrEP maintenance and discontinuation. We also developed a videotaped clinical encounter demonstrating communication skills used in PrEP counseling. Pre- and postworkshop surveys assessed participants' PrEP attitudes and knowledge. Results: All 43 survey respondents were second- through fourth-year medical students. Pre- and postpresentation evaluation of questions assessing comfort demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in level of comfort with understanding when to prescribe PrEP and in level of knowledge in prescribing PrEP. Discussion: Workshop participants acknowledged their training gaps in PrEP prescribing and acquired knowledge and comfort with prescribing PrEP for at-risk populations.\")\n",

This study described the prevalence and identified correlates of OLD among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: In 2012-2016, a community-based cohort of PWID who had injected within the past month were enrolled in a study to assess HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and their related risk factors. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews, serological testing and spirometry. Baseline data were used for a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and correlates of OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with OLD. RESULTS: Among 516 participants who had complete spirometry and interview results, the mean age was 43.3 years, 73.6 % were male, 9.5 % were Black, 91.1 % smoked cigarettes and 18.2 % had OLD. Few (9.6 %) PWID with OLD reported a previous diagnosis of COPD although many (44.7 %) reported related symptoms. Black race (AOR = 2.66, 95 %CI: 1.37, 5.17), pack-years smoked (AOR = 1.06/5 years, 95 %CI: 1.01, 1.12), and duration of injection drug use (AOR = 1.13, 95 %CI: 1.01, 1.27) were independently associated with OLD after controlling for age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OLD was high in this cohort and associated with Black race and cigarette smoking-known risk factors. In addition, OLD prevalence increased with greater duration of injection drug use, suggesting a link between cumulative exposure to injected insoluble particles and OLD.

The objectives of our study were to investigate interventions to expand donor options and to prevent ART interruptions for patients with HIV in need of alloBMT. METHODS: This single-arm, interventional trial took place at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (Baltimore, MD, USA). Individuals with HIV who were at least 18 years of age and referred for alloBMT for a standard clinical indication were eligible. The only exclusion criterion was a history of documented resistance to enfuvirtide. We used post-transplant cyclophosphamide as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to expand donor options and an optimised ART strategy of avoiding pharmacoenhancers and adding subcutaneous enfuvirtide during post-transplant cyclophosphamide and during oral medication intolerance. Our primary outcome was the proportion of participants who maintained ART through day 60 after alloBMT. We measured the HIV latent reservoir using a quantitative viral outgrowth assay. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01836068. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2013, and August 27, 2015, nine patients who were referred for transplant provided consent. Two patients had relapsed malignancy before donor searches were initiated. Seven patients had suitable donors identified (two matched sibling, two matched unrelated, two haploidentical, and one single-antigen mismatched unrelated) and proceeded to alloBMT. All patients maintained ART through day 60 and required ART changes (median 1, range 1-3) in the first 90 days. One patient stopped ART and developed HIV rebound with grade 4 meningoencephalitis at day 146. Among six patients who underwent alloBMT and had longitudinal measurements available, the HIV latent reservoir was not detected post-alloBMT in four patients with more than 95% donor chimerism, consistent with a 2.06-2.54 log10 reduction in the HIV latent reservoir. In the two patients with less than 95% donor chimerism, the HIV latent reservoir remained stable. INTERPRETATION: By using post-transplant cyclophosphamide as GVHD prophylaxis, we successfully expanded alloBMT donor options for patients with HIV. Continuing ART with a regimen that includes enfuvirtide post-alloBMT was safe, but life-threatening viral rebound can occur with ART interruption.

However, the quality of genome assembly and annotation for several macaque species lags behind the human genome effort. RESULTS: To close this gap and enhance functional genomics approaches, we used a combination of de novo linked-read assembly and scaffolding using proximity ligation assay (HiC) to assemble the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) genome. This combinatorial method yielded large scaffolds at chromosome level with a scaffold N50 of 127.5 Mb; the 23 largest scaffolds covered 90% of the entire genome. This assembly revealed large-scale rearrangements between pig-tailed macaque chromosomes 7, 12, and 13 and human chromosomes 2, 14, and 15. We subsequently annotated the genome using transcriptome and proteomics data from personalized induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the same animal. Reconstruction of the evolutionary tree using whole-genome annotation and orthologous comparisons among 3 macaque species, human, and mouse genomes revealed extensive homology between human and pig-tailed macaques with regards to both pluripotent stem cell genes and innate immune gene pathways. Our results confirm that rhesus and cynomolgus macaques exhibit a closer evolutionary distance to each other than either species exhibits to humans or pig-tailed macaques.

This study sought to assess the association between female adolescents' reproductive health decision-making capacity and their contraceptive usage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was obtained from pooled current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The unit of analysis for this study was adolescents in sexual unions [n = 15,858]. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using Pearson chi-square tests and binary logistic regression respectively. All analyses were performed using STATA version 14.2. Results were presented using Odds Ratios [OR] and adjusted Odds Ratios [AOR]. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: The results showed that 68.66% of adolescents in SSA had the capacity to make reproductive health decisions. The overall prevalence of contraceptive use was 18.87%, ranging from 1.84% in Chad to 45.75% in Zimbabwe. Adolescents who had the capacity to take reproductive health decisions had higher odds of using contraceptives [AOR = 1.47; CI = 1.31-1.65, p < 0.001]. The odds of contraceptive use among female adolescents increased with age, with those aged 19 years having the highest likelihood of using contraceptives [AOR = 3.12; CI = 2.27-34.29, p < 0.001]. Further, the higher the level of education, the more likely female adolescents will use contraceptives, and this was more predominant among those with secondary/higher education [AOR = 2.50; CI = 2.11-2.96, p < 0.001]. Female adolescents who were cohabiting had higher odds of using contraceptives, compared to those who were married [AOR = 1.69; CI = 1.47-1.95, p < 0.001]. The odds of contraceptive use was highest among female adolescents from the richest wealth quintile, compared to those from the poorest wealth quintile [AOR = 1.65; CI = 1.35-2.01, p<0.001]. Conversely, female adolescents in rural areas were less likely to use contraceptives, compared to those in urban areas [AOR = 0.78; CI = 0.69-0.89, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: The use of general and modern contraceptives among adolescents in SSA remains low. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen existing efforts on contraceptives usage among adolescents in SSA. This goal can be achieved by empowering these young females, particularly those in the rural areas where the level of literacy is very low to take positive reproductive health decisions to prevent unintended teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmitted infections. This approach would help reduce maternal mortality and early childbirth in studied SSA countries.\")\n",

Most studies have focused on the direct causes of stillbirth. The aim of this study was to determine the association between antenatal care utilization and quality with stillbirth in a Kenyan set up. This information is key when planning strategies to reduce the stillbirth burden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a case-control study in four urban tertiary hospitals carried out between August 2018 and April 2019. A total of 214 women with stillbirths (cases) and 428 with livebirths (controls) between 28 and 42 weeks were enrolled. Information was obtained through interviews and data abstracted from medical records. Antenatal care utilization was assessed by the proportions of women not attending antenatal care; booking first antenatal care visit in first trimester and not making the requisite four antenatal care visits. Quality of antenatal care was assessed using individual surrogate indicators (antenatal profile testing, weight/blood pressure/urinalysis testing in each antenatal visit, utilization of early obstetric ultrasound, completeness of antenatal records) and a codified indicator made up of seven parameters (attending antenatal care, booking first antenatal care in the first trimester, making four or more antenatal visits, having all antenatal profile tests, having a complete antenatal record, having blood pressure and weight measured at all visits). The association between antenatal care utilization and quality with stillbirth was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P value </= .05. RESULTS: Women with stillbirth were likely to have a parity >/=4 (19.6% vs 12.6%, P = .02), have an obstetric complication (36% vs 8.6%, P = .001) and have a medical disorder (5.6% vs 1.6%, P = .01). The odds of a stillbirth were four times higher among those who did not attend antenatal care ( odds ratio [OR] 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-10, P < .003). Compared with four antenatal care visits, those who had one or two visits had higher odds of a stillbirth: OR 2.96 (95% CI 1.4-6.1), P = .003, and OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5), P = .003, respectively. As per the individual surrogate indicators, the likelihood of a stillbirth was lower in women who received good quality antenatal care: Hemoglobin testing (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = .03), blood group test (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, P < .001), HIV test (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P = .001), venereal disease research laboratory test (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.4, P = .001), weight measurement (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0, P = .047). As per the composite indicator, the quality of antenatal care was poor across the board and there was no association between this surrogate indicator and stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of antenatal care, attending fewer than four antenatal visits and poor quality antenatal care as measured by surrogate indicators were significantly associated with stillbirth. In addition, women with low education level, obstetric complications, multiparity and medical complications had a significantly higher likelihood of stillbirth. Improving the utilization of four or more antenatal visits and the quality of antenatal care can reduce the risk of stillbirth.')\n",

Twenty-nine clinical indicators were extracted from medical records to compute a Frailty Index (FI) for 389 older (age 50+) PWH (range = 50-93; mean = 61.1, standard deviation = 7.2; 85% men) receiving HIV treatment in Calgary, Canada. We used regressions to identify factors associated with FI values. Latent class analysis was used to identify FI subtypes. Age, employment status, and duration of known HIV infection were the strongest predictors of FI (p's < 0.05). Four FI subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 (severe metabolic dysfunction+polypharmacy) had the highest mean FI (0.30). Subtype 2 (less severe metabolic dysfunction+polypharmacy) and Subtype 3 (lung and liver dysfunction+polypharmacy) had lower but equivalent mean FIs (0.20 for each). Subtype 4 (least severe metabolic dysfunction) had the lowest mean FI (0.13; p's < 0.001). Sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics differed among the subtypes. Individuals with Subtype 1 were older and more frequently unemployed/retired, whereas those with Subtype 3 were more likely to smoke, use crack/cocaine, have heavy alcohol use, and live in temporary/unstable housing. The clinical presentation of frailty in older PWH is heterogeneous.

Methods: 16S-rRNA gene sequencing on the Miseq-platform and qPCR for typical respiratory pathogens were performed on sputum samples collected from 64 PLW-HIV (median blood CD4 count 676 cells/muL) and 38 HIV-negative participants. Finding: Richness and alpha-diversity as well as the relative-abundance (RA) of the major taxa (RA>1%) were similar between both groups. In unweighted-Unifrac ss-diversity, the samples from PLW-HIV showed greater diversity, in contrast to the HIV negative samples which clustered together. Gut bacterial taxa such as Bilophila and members of Enterobacteriaceae as well as pathogenic respiratory taxa (Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were significantly more frequent in PLW-HIV and almost absent in the HIV-negative group. Carriage of these taxa was correlated with the length of time between HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART (Spearman-rho=0.279, p=0.028). Interpretation: Although the core airway microbiome was indistinguishable between PLW-HIV on effective ART and HIV-negative participants, PLW-HIV's respiratory microbiome was enriched with potential respiratory pathogens and gut bacteria. The observed differences in PLW-HIV may be due to HIV infection altering the local lung microenvironment to be more permissive to harbour pathogenic bacteria that could contribute to respiratory comorbidities.

Study Design: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 6 months was used to execute the study. Materials and Methods: Forty-seven subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (n=22 RBAC and n=25 placebo) for 6 months with assessments at baseline and 3 and 6 months. A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance model was used to assess the differences between RBAC and placebo groups in cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure), endothelial function (skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide), and immune (CD4(+) cell count) markers from baseline to 6 months. Results: The effect of treatment (RBAC versus placebo) was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.92, F[3, 102]=3.07, P=0.03). The effect of time was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.10, F[2, 103]=474.6, P<0.001). The overall interaction between treatment and time was significant (Wilks' lambda=0.92, F[2, 103]=4.58, P=0.01). Time contrasts showed that a difference in the overall dependent variable did not occur from baseline to 3 months (F[1, 104]=2.7, P=0.10), marginally occurred from baseline to 6 months (F[1, 104]=3.2, P=0.08), and was significant from 3 to 6 months (F[1, 104]=6.43, P=0.01). Conclusions: The overall significant interaction suggests varying responses in the dependent variables between RBAC and placebo over time, which is being driven by systolic blood pressure, as it decreased in the RBAC group, but increased in the placebo group. In addition, CD4(+) manifested a non-significant increase from baseline to 3 months then decreased from 3 to 6 months in the RBAC group, whereas it decreased at 3 months followed by a slight increase at 6 months in the placebo group. Skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide improved non-significantly overall in both groups, but worsened from 3 to 6 months in the placebo group. Thus, RBAC treatment may contribute to modest short-term improvements in systolic blood pressure, endothelial function, and CD4(+) cell count, which could help improve the overall health profile of HIV(+) adults. Relevance for Patients: Persons with HIV on ART suffer disproportionately from hypertension and endothelial dysfunction compared to the non-infected population, and conventional medical therapy does not alleviate these issues. RBAC is a safe, low-risk alternative that may help to improve the overall quality of life of these patients through modest improvements in these biomarkers plus CD4(+) cell count.\")\n",

Important lessons can be drawn from past Ebola outbreaks and the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic on how communities should be central to COVID-19 responses. Communities are complex and only their members can inform public health experts about their lived realities, the community's understanding of the outbreak and what will work locally to reduce transmission. The public should be encouraged to take positive actions to ensure their own health and well-being, rather than made to feel powerless.

RESULTS: We found striking within-country and between-country variation in MC prevalence; most (12 of 14) priority countries had more than a twofold difference between their first administrative level units with the highest and lowest estimated prevalence in 2017. Although estimated national MC prevalence increased in all priority countries with the onset of VMMC campaigns, seven priority countries contained both subnational areas where estimated MC prevalence increased and areas where estimated MC prevalence decreased after the initiation of VMMC campaigns. In 2017, only three priority countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania) were likely to have reached the MC coverage target of 80% at the national level, and no priority country was likely to have reached this goal in all subnational areas. CONCLUSIONS: Despite MC prevalence increases in all priority countries since the onset of VMMC campaigns in 2008, MC prevalence remains below the 80% coverage target in most subnational areas and is highly variable. These mapped results provide an actionable tool for understanding local needs and informing VMMC interventions for maximum impact in the continued effort towards ending the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.')\n",

However, some people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced have limited or no treatment options, owing to multidrug resistance(6). In addition, suboptimal adherence to oral daily regimens can negatively affect the outcome of treatment-which contributes to virologic failure, resistance generation and viral transmission-as well as of pre-exposure prophylaxis, leading to new infections(1,2,4,7-9). Long-acting agents from new antiretroviral classes can provide much-needed treatment options for people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced, and additionally can improve adherence(10). Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV.')\n",

Implementing an evidence-based, task-shared intervention for antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and substance use integrated into HIV care may be a feasible and effective way to improve HIV treatment outcomes and reduce substance use in this population. Methods: Guided by the RE-AIM framework, a randomized, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial (n = 60) is being used to evaluate a peer-delivered intervention that integrates evidence-based intervention components, including Life-Steps (problem solving and motivational skills for HIV medication adherence), behavioral activation to increase alternative, substance-free rewarding activities in one's environment, and relapse prevention skills, including mindfulness. The comparison condition is enhanced standard of care, which includes facilitating a referral to a local substance use treatment clinic (Matrix). Participants are followed for a period of 6 months.

Focusing on procedures required to accurately determine recent infection, and the potential for recent infection surveillance to inform prevention efforts, we present the results of three independent but linked pilots of recency testing. METHODS: To distinguish recently acquired HIV infection from long-standing infection, in 2018 we applied a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm that combined a laboratory-based Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunoassay with clinical information (viral-load; history of prior HIV diagnosis; antiretroviral therapy-exposure). We explored potential misclassification of test results and analysed the characteristics of participants with recent infection. We applied the algorithm in antenatal clinics providing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Siaya County, Kenya, outreach sites serving female sex workers in Zimbabwe, and routine HIV testing and counselling facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. In Nairobi, we also conducted recency testing among partners of HIV-positive participants. RESULTS: In Siaya County, 2.3% (10/426) of HIV-positive pregnant women were classified as recent. A risk factor analysis comparing women testing recent with those testing HIV-negative found women in their first trimester were significantly more likely to test recent than those in their second or third trimester. In Zimbabwe, 10.5% (33/313) of female sex workers testing HIV-positive through the outreach programme were classified recent. A risk factor analysis of women testing recent versus those testing HIV-negative, found no strong evidence of an association with recent infection. In Nairobi, among 532 HIV-positive women and men, 8.6% (46) were classified recent. Among partners of participants, almost a quarter of those who tested HIV-positive were classified as recent (23.8%; 5/21). In all three settings, the inclusion of clinical information helped improve the positive predictive value of recent infection testing by removing cases that were likely misclassified. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified recently acquired infections among persons testing HIV-positive in routine testing settings and highlight the importance of incorporating additional information to accurately classify recent infection. We identified a number of groups with a significantly higher proportion of recent infection, suggesting recent infection surveillance, when rolled-out nationally, may help in further targeting primary prevention efforts.')\n",

Violence measures were adapted from the ICAST-C and the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence. Youth could report up to 12 perpetrator types for past-year experiences of violence. We estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex, disaggregated by sex and age group. Estimates were weighted using sex and age data from the 2013-14 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey to be representative of HIV-positive AYA in Zambia. RESULTS: Estimated lifetime prevalence of any violence victimization was 78.2%. Past-year prevalence was 72.0% among males and 74.5% among females. Almost half of AYA (46.1%) had ever experienced polyvictimization (2+ types of violence). Psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year) and forced sex (10.4% lifetime, 4.7% past-year).

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) demonstration projects observe that AGYW uptake and adherence to PrEP during risk periods is suboptimal. Judgemental interactions with healthcare workers (HCW) and inadequate counselling can be barriers to PrEP use among AGYW. Improving HCW competency and communication to support PrEP delivery to AGYW requires new strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PrEP Implementation for Young Women and Adolescents Program-standardised patient (PrIYA-SP) is a cluster randomised trial of a standardised patient actor (SP) training intervention designed to improve HCW adherence to PrEP guidelines and communication skills. We purposively selected 24 clinics offering PrEP services under fully programmatic conditions in Kisumu County, Kenya. At baseline, unannounced SP 'mystery shoppers' present to clinics portraying AGYW in common PrEP scenarios for a cross-sectional assessment of PrEP delivery. Twelve facilities will be randomised to receive a 2-day training intervention, consisting of lectures, role-playing with SPs and group debriefing. Unannounced SPs will repeat the assessment in all 24 sites following the intervention. The primary outcome is quality of PrEP counselling, including adherence to national guidelines and communication skills, scored on a checklist by SPs blinded to intervention assignment. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will evaluate whether the intervention resulted in higher scores within intervention compared with control facilities, adjusted for baseline SP scores and accounting for clustering by facility. We hypothesise that the intervention will improve quality of PrEP counselling compared with standard of care. Results from this study will inform guidelines for PrEP delivery to AGYW in low-resource settings and offer a potentially scalable strategy to improve service delivery for this high-risk group.

Children are tested primarily in outpatient clinics, which show low HIV-positive rates. To demonstrate efficient facility-based HIV testing among children aged 0-14 years, we evaluated pediatric HIV-positivity rates in points of service in select health facilities in Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of HIV testing and case identification among children aged 0-14 years at all points of service at nine purposively sampled hospitals (November 2016-March 2017). Points of service included family index testing, pediatric outpatient department (POPD), tuberculosis (TB) clinics, immunization clinics, and pediatric inpatient ward. Eligibility for testing at POPD was done using a screening tool while all children with unknown status were eligible for HIV test at other points of service. The main outcome was HIV positivity rates stratified by the testing point of service and by age group. Predictors of an HIV-positive result were assessed using logistic regression. All analyses were done using Stata 15 statistical software. RESULTS: Of 2,180 children seen at all facility points of service with unknown HIV status, 1,822 (83.6%) were tested for HIV, of whom 43 (2.4%) tested HIV positive. The numbers of children tested by age group were <1 years = 230 (12.6%); 1-4 years = 752 (41.3%); 5-9 years = 520 (28.5%); and 10-14 years = 320 (17.6%). The number of children tested by point of service were POPD = 906 (49.7%); family index testing = 693 (38.0%); pediatric inpatient ward = 192 (10.5%); immunization clinic = 16 (0.9%); and TB clinic = 15 (0.8%).

The mechanisms of fat alterations in PLWH are complex, multifactorial and not fully understood, although they are known to result in part from the direct effects of HIV proteins and antiretroviral agents on adipocyte health, genetic factors, increased microbial translocation, changes in the adaptive immune milieu after infection, increased tissue inflammation and accelerated fibrosis.

Despite the importance of HIV testing services (HTS) in HIV control, uptake of HTS among female sex workers (FSWs) across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains sub-optimal. Concerns about stigma associated with sex work and fear of loss of livelihood if HIV status becomes known, are some of the restrictions for FSWs to utilize HTS offered through health care facilities. Introduction of HIV self-testing (HIVST) may mitigate some of the barriers for the uptake of HTS. This study explored the acceptability of FSWs towards the introduction of HIVST in Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study employing in-depth interviews (IDI) and participatory group discussions (PGD) with FSWs in selected regions of Tanzania. Study participants were recruited through snowball sampling. Data were thematically analysed by two analysts using NVivo software. The analysis was informed by the social-ecological model and focused on factors associated with the acceptability of HIVST. RESULTS: We conducted 21 PGD sessions involving 227 FSWs. Twenty three IDIs were conducted to complement data collected through PGD. Our study has demonstrated that FSWs are enthusiastic toward HIVST. Convenience (time and cost saved), and belief that HIVST will increase privacy and confidentiality motivated participants' support for the self-testing approach. Participants did express concerns about their ability to interpret and trust the results of the test. Participants also expressed concern that HIVST could cause personal harm, including severe distress and self-harm for individuals with a reactive test. Very likely, concern about adverse effects of HIVST was linked to the study participants' lay perception that HIVST would be provided only through unassisted modality. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs demonstrated high enthusiasm to use the HIVST once it becomes available. Expectations for increased confidentiality, autonomy, and reduced opportunity costs were among the leading factors that attracted FSWs to HIVST. The major obstacles to the acceptability of HIVST included fear of HIV reactive test and not trusting self-diagnoses. Our findings underscore the importance of providing adequate access to counselling and referral services in conjunction with HIVST.\")\n",

The Hologic Panther system uses 0.7mL total volume for the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Assay standard (APT-Quant-std) and dilution (APT-Quant-dil) protocols. However, smaller plasma volumes from fingerstick whole blood (FSB) collected in EDTA-microtainer tubes (MCT) could provide an easier sample collection method for HIV-1 VL testing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the APT-Quant-std compared to the Roche CAP/CTM and Abbott m2000RT VL assays and an alternative APTQuant 1:7 dilution protocol, the latter using 100muL of MCT-derived plasma from FSB. STUDY DESIGN: Linearity was determined using commercial HIV-1 RNA plasma controls. Dilutions ranging 1.56-2.95 log10 copies/mL were prepared to determine the APT-Quant-dil Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) using Probit analysis. Specificity of APT-Quant-std was calculated using 326 HIVnegative samples. To evaluate agreement, 329 plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std, CAP/CTM, and m2000RT. Forty-seven matched venipuncture and MCT-derived plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std and APT-Quant-dil. RESULTS: Among the RNA controls, specificity was 99.69 % for APT-Quant-std. The R2 values were 0.988 (APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM), 0.980 (APT-Quant-std/ m2000RT), and 0.997 (APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil). The APT-Quant-dil LOQ was estimated at 2.7 log10 copies/mL (500 copies/mL) (95 %CI 2.62-2.87). At 2.3 log10 copies/mL (200 copies/mL), the overall agreement was 91.0 % for APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM, 85.7 % for APT-Quant-std/m2000RT, and 82.9 % for APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil. Quantified APT-Quant-std results were on average 0.2 log10 copies/mL higher than CAP/CTM and m2000RT and 0.14 log10 copies/mL higher than APT-Quant-dil. CONCLUSION: APT-Quant showed similar performance compared to the CAP/CTM and m2000RT assays and remains sensitive and accurate using the dilution protocol.')\n",

A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = - 14, y = - 24, z = - 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC.

Proteins facilitating adaptation to novel environments, such as chaperones, may be required for virulence. In this study, we identified a novel mitochondrial co-chaperone, Mrj1 (mitochondrial respiration J-domain protein 1), necessary for virulence in C. neoformans The mrj1Delta and J-domain-inactivated mutants had general growth defects at both routine laboratory and human body temperatures and were deficient in the major virulence factor of capsule elaboration. The latter phenotype was associated with cell wall changes and increased capsular polysaccharide shedding. Accordingly, the mrj1Delta mutant was avirulent in a murine model of cryptococcosis. Mrj1 has a mitochondrial localization and co-immunoprecipitated with Qcr2, a core component of complex III of the electron transport chain. The mrj1 mutants were deficient in mitochondrial functions, including growth on alternative carbon sources, growth without iron, and mitochondrial polarization. They were also insensitive to complex III inhibitors and hypersensitive to an alternative oxidase (AOX) inhibitor, suggesting that Mrj1 functions in respiration. In support of this conclusion, mrj1 mutants also had elevated basal oxygen consumption rates which were completely abolished by the addition of the AOX inhibitor, confirming that Mrj1 is required for mitochondrial respiration through complexes III and IV. Furthermore, inhibition of complex III phenocopied the capsule and cell wall defects of the mrj1 mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that Mrj1 is required for normal mitochondrial respiration, a key aspect of adaptation to the host environment and virulence.IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis, a disease responsible for approximately 15% of all HIV-related deaths. Unfortunately, development of antifungal drugs is challenging because potential targets are conserved between humans and C. neoformans In this context, we characterized a unique J-domain protein, Mrj1, which lacks orthologs in humans. We showed that Mrj1 was required for normal mitochondrial respiration and that mutants lacking Mrj1 were deficient in growth, capsule elaboration, and virulence. Furthermore, we were able to phenocopy the defects in growth and capsule elaboration by inhibiting respiration. This result suggests that the role of Mrj1 in mitochondrial function was responsible for the observed virulence defects and reinforces the importance of mitochondria to fungal pathogenesis. Mitochondria are difficult to target, as their function is also key to human cells; however, Mrj1 presents an opportunity to target a unique fungal protein required for mitochondrial function and virulence in C. neoformans.')\n",

The virus has since evolved to form distinct clades, which spread to different regions of the world. The envelope glycoproteins (Envs) of HIV-1 have rapidly diversified in all infected populations. We examined whether key antigenic sites of Env and signatures of vaccine efficacy are evolving toward similar or distinct structural forms in different populations worldwide. Patterns of amino acid variants that emerged at each position of Env were compared between diverse HIV-1 clades and isolates from different geographic regions. Interestingly, at each Env position, the amino acid in the clade ancestral or regional-founder virus was replaced by a unique frequency distribution (FD) of amino acids. FDs are highly conserved in populations from different regions worldwide and in paraphyletic and monophyletic subclade groups. Remarkably, founder effects of Env mutations at the clade and regional levels have gradually decreased during the pandemic by evolution of each site toward the unique combination of variants. Therefore, HIV-1 Env is evolving at a population level toward well-defined \"target\" states; these states are not specific amino acids but rather specific distributions of amino acid frequencies. Our findings reveal the powerful nature of the forces that guide evolution of Env and their conservation across different populations. Such forces have caused a gradual decrease in the interpopulation diversity of Env despite an increasing intrapopulation diversity.IMPORTANCE The Env protein of HIV-1 is the primary target in AIDS vaccine design. Frequent mutations in the virus increase the number of Env forms in each population, limiting the efficacy of AIDS vaccines. Comparison of newly emerging forms in different populations showed that each position of Env is evolving toward a specific combination of amino acids. Similar changes are occurring in different HIV-1 subtypes and geographic regions toward the same position-specific combinations of amino acids, often from distinct ancestral sequences. The predictable nature of HIV-1 Env evolution, as shown here, provides a new framework for designing vaccines that are tailored to the unique combination of variants expected to emerge in each virus subtype and geographic region.')\n",

We have investigated the potential for using CD4(+) T cells arising in response to BCG as a source of help for driving Ab responses against viral vaccines. To test this approach, we designed vaccines comprised of protein immunogens fused to an immunodominant CD4(+) T cell epitope of the secreted Ag 85B protein of BCG.

Exposure of Interest We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with regression discontinuity methods to estimate changes in outpatient clinic visitation from 60 days before through 35 days after the lockdown period. Outcome Measures Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses we assessed visitation for the following sub-categories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases, and by age and sex strata. Results We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day from prior to and during the lockdown (-6.9 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI -17.4, 3.7) or trends in clinic visitation over time during the lockdown period (-0.2, 95%CI -3.4, 3.1).

Findings: Baseline plasma viral loads were low (median 8000 copies per mL), with 12% of infants having undetectable viraemia pre-cART initiation. However, barely one-third (37%) of children achieved suppression of viraemia by 6 months that was maintained to >12 months. 24% had died or were lost to follow up by 6 months. Infant mortality was 9.3%. The high-frequency virological failure in IU-infected infants was associated not with transmitted or acquired drug-resistant mutations but with cART non-adherence (plasma cART undetectable/subtherapeutic, p<0.0001) and with concurrent maternal cART failure (OR 15.0, 95%CI 5.6-39.6; p<0.0001). High-frequency virological failure was observed in PoC- and SoC-tested groups of children. Interpretation: The success of early infant testing and cART initiation strategies is severely limited by subsequent cART non-adherence in HIV-infected children. Although there are practical challenges to administering paediatric cART formulations, these are overcome by mothers who themselves are cART-adherent. These findings point to the ongoing obligation to address the unmet needs of the mothers.

Penalized maximum likelihood logistic regression and Poisson regression were applied to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: The overall HIV incidence rate among participants was 2.9/100 women-years. Among socio-demographic characteristics, the multivariable analysis showed a significant association of marital status with HIV incidence in pregnancy (IRR 8.78, 95%CI [1.13-68.33]). Risky sexual behaviors including higher number of sexual partners in pregnancy (IRR 2.78 [1.30-5.94]), unprotected sex with unknown persons (IRR 14.25 [4.52-44.93]), alcohol abuse (IRR 12.08 [4.18-34.90]) and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (IRR 6.33 [1.36-29.49]) were significantly associated with seroconversion in pregnancy (similar results in logistic regression). CONCLUSIONS: HIV incidence was three times higher among our pregnant study population compared to the general female population in Uganda. This underlines the importance of HIV prevention and repeat testing during pregnancy. Identified risk groups should be considered for pre-exposure prophylaxis.\")\n",

Sexual behavior assessments can elicit problematic data.

We programed conversational interviewing elements into 20 sexual behavior questions in an exit survey of gay bathhouse patrons (N = 459) administered using ACASI. Those elements, called alternate pathways, included follow-up questions to responses to confirm that operational definitions were applied in the answer (with return to the initial question if confirmation failed), and assurances of confidentiality and requests for best guesses in reaction to non-response (including \"don\\'t know\"). These elements were invoked in nearly 10% of participants, and approximately 74% of all invocations resulted in a usable numeric response, or 87% if the data need only estimate prevalence. Almost two-thirds of the problematic data issues occurred in answers to sexual contact questions, with others related to follow-up questions about specific sexual behavior.

To address these gaps, we conducted a cross-sectional study among patients with a history of HCV infection (n = 270) at outpatient clinics in Philadelphia from July 2018 to May 2019. We evaluated stigma using the validated HCV Stigma Scale, adapted from the Berger HIV Stigma Scale.

Most participants (95.5%) experienced HCV-related stigma. Mean stigma scores did not differ significantly between HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected participants (P = .574). However, we observed significant interactions between HIV status and multiple determinants; therefore, we stratified analyses by HIV status. Among HIV/HCV-coinfected participants, previous HCV treatment without cure, female gender, Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity and some college education were significantly associated with higher HCV-stigma scores. An annual income of $10 000-$40 000 was associated with significantly lower stigma scores. No significant associations were observed among HCV-monoinfected participants.

The analysis performed in four stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights did the following: i) created a complex sample plan file in SPSS, ii) performed the weighted estimate of HIV prevalence, iii) performed complex sample chi-square test of independence, and then iv) performed complex sample logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Out of 11,270 participants, 1,469 (13.0%) tested positive for HIV. The prevalence of HIV infection was higher in females (15.1%) than males (10.2%). We found that urban dwellers were more likely to be HIV-positive compared to rural dwellers (AOR: 1.70; CI: 1.27, 2.27).

ICF and BRINDA values of SZC were highly correlated (p < 0.001, r = 0.99), but a Bland-Altman plot showed a lack of agreement between the two methods (bias of 2.07 microg/dL). There was no association between the adjusted SZC and stunting, which is a proxy indicator for zinc deficiency. Inflammation adjustment of SZC, using ICF or BRINDA, produces lower estimates of zinc deficiency prevalence, but the lack of agreement between the adjustment methods warrants further research. Furthermore, the lack of association between SZC and stunting highlights the need to explore other biomarkers and proxies of population zinc assessment. This study demonstrates the importance of considering inflammatory confounders when reporting SZC, to ensure accuracy and to support policy decision making.')\n",

To facilitate biopharmaceutical production, it is necessary to produce these in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, the cellular substrate used for the manufacturing of most recombinant protein therapeutics. However, previous studies have shown that when recombinant Env proteins from clade B viruses, the major subtype represented in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, are expressed in CHO cells, they are proteolyzed and lack important glycan-dependent epitopes present on virions. Previously, we identified C1s, a serine protease in the complement pathway, as the endogenous CHO protease responsible for the cleavage of clade B laboratory isolates of -recombinant gp120s (rgp120s) expressed in stable CHO-S cell lines. In this paper, we describe the development of two novel CHOK1 cell lines with the C1s gene inactivated by gene editing, that are suitable for the production of any protein susceptible to C1s proteolysis. One cell line, C1s-/- CHOK1 2.E7, contains a deletion in the C1s gene. The other cell line, C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1, contains a deletion in both the C1s gene and the MGAT1 gene, which limits glycosylation to mannose-5 or earlier intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. In addition, we compare the substrate specificity of C1s with thrombin on the cleavage of both rgp120 and human Factor VIII, two recombinant proteins known to undergo unintended proteolysis (clipping) when expressed in CHO cells. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and practicality of the C1s-/- MGAT1- CHOK1 1.A1 cell line for the expression of clinical isolates of clade B Envs from rare individuals that possess broadly neutralizing antibodies and are able to control virus replication without anti-retroviral drugs (elite neutralizer/controller phenotypes).

These illnesses are a common cause of ill health in the general population and any increase in their frequency or severity in PLW-HIV might have significant implications for health-related quality of life and the development of chronic respiratory disease. METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study following PLW-HIV and HIV negative participants for 12 months with weekly documentation of any acute respiratory illness, we compared the frequency, severity and healthcare use associated with acute respiratory illnesses to determine whether PLW-HIV continue to have a greater frequency or severity of such illnesses despite antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: We followed-up 136 HIV positive and 73 HIV negative participants for 12 months with weekly documentation of any new respiratory symptoms. We found that HIV status did not affect the frequency of acute respiratory illness: unadjusted incidence rates per person year of follow-up were 2.08 illnesses (95% CI 1.81-2.38) and 2.30 illnesses (1.94-2.70) in HIV positive and negative participants respectively, IRR 0.87 (0.70-1.07) p = 0.18. However, when acute respiratory illnesses occurred, PLW-HIV reported more severe symptoms (relative fold-change in symptom score 1.61 (1.28-2.02), p <0.001) and were more likely to seek healthcare advice (42% vs 18% of illnesses, odds ratio 3.32 (1.48-7.39), p = 0.003). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PLW-HIV still had higher symptom scores when unwell. CONCLUSIONS: HIV suppression with antiretroviral therapy reduces the frequency of acute respiratory illness to background levels, however when these occur, they are associated with more severe self-reported symptoms and greater healthcare utilisation. Exploration of the reasons for this greater severity of acute respiratory illness may allow targeted interventions to improve the health of people living with HIV.

For HIV, Ebola, influenza and numerous other viruses, envelope glycoproteins bind the infecting virion to cell-surface receptors and mediate membrane fusion. In the case of influenza, the receptor-binding glycoprotein is the haemagglutinin (HA), and following receptor-mediated uptake of the bound virus by endocytosis(1), it is the HA that mediates fusion of the virus envelope with the membrane of the endosome(2). Each subunit of the trimeric HA consists of two disulfide-linked polypeptides, HA1 and HA2. The larger, virus-membrane-distal, HA1 mediates receptor binding; the smaller, membrane-proximal, HA2 anchors HA in the envelope and contains the fusion peptide, a region that is directly involved in membrane interaction(3). The low pH of endosomes activates fusion by facilitating irreversible conformational changes in the glycoprotein. The structures of the initial HA at neutral pH and the final HA at fusion pH have been investigated by electron microscopy(4,5) and X-ray crystallography(6-8). Here, to further study the process of fusion, we incubate HA for different times at pH 5.0 and directly image structural changes using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy.

Several studies have pointed to communication about sexuality between parents/caregivers and children as a protective factor. However, communication between generations has been described as problematic, especially due to discomfort in discussing sexual matters. The aim of this study was to explore how caregivers in a poor, rural part of South Africa talked about young people in general, their sexuality, and their lifestyle practices. A particular interest was directed towards central discourses in the caregivers' narratives and how these discourses were of importance for the caregivers to function as conversation partners for young people. METHODS: In this qualitative study convenience sampling was used to select and invite participants. Information was collected from nine one-on-one interviews conducted with caregivers from rural areas within South Africa. The interview guide included nine main questions and optional probing questions. Each interview took place in an uninterrupted setting of choice associated with the caregivers' home environment. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using discourse analysis. RESULTS: Interview narratives were characterized by three central discourses - demoralized youths in a changing society, prevailing risks and modernity and a generation gap. The youths were discursively constructed as a problematic group relating to specific prevailing risks such as early pregnancies, modern technologies, STI/HIV and contraceptives. The interview narratives illustrated that caregivers tried to impose their views of a respectable lifestyle in young people. At the same time caregivers expressed a morality of despair mirroring a generation gap which counteracted their ability to communicate with their children and grandchildren. CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to the body of earlier research illustrating that rural South African caregivers and their children/grandchildren hold different moral standards. The interview material reflected a 'clash' between generations relating to their differing perceptions of a desirable lifestyle. To overcome the generational gap, we recommend further research about how a well-founded national and community collaboration linked to school-based programs can support family participation in order to empower adults in their communication with young people.\")\n",

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries' characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.\")\n",

METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question.

Such approaches draw on deep-rooted historical traditions of indigenous groups in combination with imported traditions which emerged from colonial engagement. To date, no review has sought to map the locations, health issues, art forms and methods documented by researchers using arts-based approaches in SSA. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology, 11 databases spanning biomedicine, arts and humanities and social sciences were searched. Researchers screened search results for papers using predefined criteria. Papers included in the review were read and summarised using a standardised proforma. Descriptive statistics were produced to characterise the location of the studies, art forms used or discussed, and the health issues addressed, and to determine how best to summarise the literature identified. RESULTS: Searches identified a total of 59 794 records, which reduced to 119 after screening. We identified literature representing 30 (62.5%) of the 48 countries in the SSA region. The papers covered 16 health issues. The majority (84.9%) focused on HIV/AIDS-related work, with Ebola (5.0%) and malaria (3.3%) also receiving attention.

Unexpectedly, myristoylation efficiency of MA(NOS) in Escherichia coli by co-expressed mammalian NMT was reduced by ~70% compared to the wild-type protein. NMR studies revealed that residues of the N-terminal myristoylation signal are fully exposed and mobile in the native protein but partially sequestered in the MA(NOS) chimera, suggesting that the unusual FIV sequence is conserved to promote exposure and efficient myristoylation of the MA N terminus. In contrast, virus assembly studies indicate that the MA(NOS) mutation does not affect virus assembly, but does prevent virus spread, in feline kidney cells.

However, to our knowledge, trends over time in HIV prevalence among PWID in US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) across all major regions of the country have not been systematically estimated beyond 2002, and the extent to which HIV prevalence may be increasing in other areas is largely unknown. This article estimates HIV prevalence among PWID in 89 of the most populated US MSAs, both overall and by geographic region, using more recent surveillance and HIV testing data. METHODS: We computed MSA-specific annual estimates of HIV prevalence (both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections) among PWID for these 89 MSAs, for 1992-2013, using several data series from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National HIV Surveillance System and National HIV Prevention Monitoring and Evaluation data; Holmberg's (1997) estimates of 1992 PWID population size and of HIV prevalence and incidence among PWID; and research estimates from published literature using 1992-2013 data. A mixed effects model, with time nested within MSAs, was used to regress the literature review estimates on all of the other data series. Multiple imputation was used to address missing data. Resulting estimates were validated using previous 1992-2002 estimates of HIV prevalence and data on antiretroviral (ARV) prescription volumes and examined for patterns based on geographic region, numbers of people tested for HIV, and baseline HIV prevalence. RESULTS: Mean (across all MSAs) trends over time suggested decreases through 2002 (from approximately 11.4% in 1992 to 9.2% in 2002), followed by a period of stability, and steep increases after 2010 (to 10.6% in 2013). Validation analyses found a moderate positive correlation between our estimates and ARV prescription volumes (r = 0.45), and a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.94) between our estimates and previous estimates by Tempalski et al. (2009) for 1992-2002 (which used different methods). Analysis by region and baseline prevalence suggested that mean increases in later years were largely driven by MSAs in the Western United States and by MSAs in the Midwest that had low baseline prevalence. Our estimates suggest that prevalence decreased across all years in the Eastern United States. These trends were particularly clear when MSAs with very low numbers of people tested for HIV were removed from analyses to reduce unexplained variability in mean trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest a fairly large degree of variation in 1992-2013 trajectories of PWID HIV prevalence among 89 US MSAs, particularly by geographic region. They suggest that public health responses in many MSAs (particularly those with larger HIV prevalence among PWID in the early 1990s) were sufficient to decrease or maintain HIV prevalence over time. However, future research should investigate potential factors driving the estimated increase in prevalence after 2002 MSAs in the West and Midwest. These findings have potentially important implications for program and/or policy decisions, but estimates for MSAs with low HIV testing denominators should be interpreted with caution and verified locally before planning action.\")\n",

Virosomes reconstituted from the powder forms remained as free particles with similar size, virosome uptake by antigen-presenting cells in vitro was comparable to virosomes from the liquid form, and the presence of excipients specific to each solid form did not prevent virosome transport to the draining lymph nodes of immunized mice.

They are therefore an important population for HIV prevention globally. Despite very low HIV testing coverage among MWPS in many countries, the role of HIV self-testing to increase testing coverage has not been explored. We, therefore, conducted a pilot intervention study to evaluate the uptake and acceptability of assisted and unassisted HIV self-testing among MWPS in Indonesia. METHODS: MWPS attending seven brothels in Bali between December 2017 and January 2018 were recruited by lay health providers to participate in a brief health survey, and then invited to have a HIV self-test (assisted or unassisted) with an OraQuick(R) ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test and complete a post-test acceptability survey. RESULTS: A total of 292 men completed the health survey (response rate: 70%) and 188 (64.6%) accepted HIV self-testing. Of these men, 13.3% had ever tested for HIV and 58.9% reported condom use at their last sexual encounter with a brothel-based female sex worker. Nearly all men (98.9%) who accepted a HIV self-test preferred assisted HIV self-testing - of whom 83.9% preferred to be fully assisted and 16.1% opted to be partially assisted and read their results privately. Of the men who accepted the test and showed the result to the lay health providers, 4 (2.1%) received reactive results. Linkage following HIV self-test is a concern, as none of the four men with a reactive result attended HIV testing at the recommended referral HIV testing clinic over a two-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to investigate the acceptance of HIV self-testing when offered to MWPS in brothels by lay health providers. The high uptake of HIV self-testing suggests that this testing model is acceptable and could increase the very low HIV testing coverage among MWPS. The strong preference for fully assisted HIV self-testing highlights the importance of involving lay health providers in future testing programs. When scaling up HIV self-testing programmatically, strategies to improve linkage-to-care should be considered and evaluated.')\n",

Home-based HIV couple testing during the antenatal period is a safe and effective method that has been used to test male partners of pregnant women. The goal of this qualitative study was to identify elements that made couple testing successful and describe important characteristics of this home-based intervention from couples' perspectives. METHODS: Couples who received scheduled home-based couple testing during pregnancy in Kisumu, Kenya, were purposively sampled based on HIV status from January to May 2015. An interviewer administered all of the in-depth interviews and two coders were directly involved in the data analysis and reconciled codes several times in the process. RESULTS: Twenty-one couples were enrolled: 9 concordant HIV-negative couples, 8 HIV discordant couples, 3 HIV concordant HIV-positive couples, and 1 whose concordance status was unknown. Median age at the time of home-based couple testing was 24 and 28 years for women and men, respectively. Median relationship duration was 3 years and couples had a median of two pregnancies. The major themes that emerged were that home-based couple testing 1) removed the female burden of requesting couple testing, 2) overcame logistical barriers associated with clinic-based testing, 3) encouraged participants to overcome their fear of testing and disclosure, 4) provided privacy in the home, and 5) provided quality time with the health advisors. Importantly, some women appreciated individual testing at the clinic before couple testing and some couples preferred skilled, anonymous health advisors delivering the intervention rather than known community health workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this qualitative study suggest that home-based couple testing during pregnancy overcame many of the barriers that limit men's access to and uptake of clinic-based testing. It encouraged participants to overcome their fear of testing and disclosure through a setting that afforded privacy and quality time with skilled health advisors. These qualitative results may help design effective partner and couple HIV testing programs in the antenatal setting and alongside or within other assisted partner notification services.

The United States has witnessed an unprecedented opioid overdose epidemic since 2013 that derives primarily from commonly injected illicit opioids (e.g., heroin and fentanyl) (2).

Evidence in animal models have shown that markers of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation vary over the course of the day and are affected by food intake and circadian rhythms. However, daily variations of these markers are not characterized yet in PLWH. Herein, we assessed the variation of these markers over 24 h in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a well-controlled environment. METHODS: As in Canada, PLWH are predominantly men and the majority of them are now over 50 years old, we selected 11 men over 50 receiving ART with undetectable viremia for more than 3 years in this pilot study. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over 24 h before snacks/meals from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 the next day. All participants consumed similar meals at set times, and had a comparable amount of sleep, physical exercise and light exposure. Plasma levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fungal (1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan (BDG) translocation markers, along with markers of intestinal damage fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and regenerating islet-derived protein-3alpha (REG3alpha) were assessed by ELISA or the fungitell assay. RESULTS: Participants had a median age of 57 years old (range 50 to 63). Plasma levels of BDG and REG3alpha did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In contrast, a significant increase of LPS was detected between 12:00 and 16:00 (Z-score: - 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.16 +/- 0.15, p = 0.02), and between 12:00 and 24:00 (- 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.89 +/- 0.26, p < 0.001). The plasma levels of I-FABP at 16:00 (- 0.92 +/- 0.09) were also significantly lower, compared to 8:00 the first day (0.48 +/- 0.26, p = 0.002), 4:00 (0.73 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001) or 8:00 on secondary day (0.88 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Conversely to the fungal translocation marker BDG and the gut damage marker REG3alpha, time of blood collection matters for the proper evaluation for LPS and I-FABP as markers for the risk of inflammatory non-AIDS co-morbidities.

Method: Narrative review. Results: HIV enhances susceptibility to opportunistic eye infections, has direct pathogenic effects, and places patients at risk of immune recovery inflammatory syndromes in previously infected eyes after starting highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Widespread availability of HAART has resulted in a decrease of infectious ocular conditions such as cytomegalovirus retinitis, toxoplasmic retinitis, squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and microvascular retinopathy. However, large coexisting burdens of tuberculosis, herpesvirus infection and syphilis (among others) continue to contribute to the burden of ocular disease, especially in low-resource settings. Growing risks of cataract, retinopathy and retinal nerve fiber thinning can affect patients with chronic HIV on HAART; thought due to chronic inflammation and immune activation.

Objectives: To: (i) estimate the prevalence and trends in overweight/obesity by duration of exposure to ART among recipients, (ii) assess changes in BMI categories among ART recipients between their first clinic visit (BMI-1) and their last clinic visit (BMI-2), (iii) identify ART regimen that predicts overweight/obesity better than the others and factors associated with BMI changes among ART recipients. Methods: A 12-year retrospective record-based review was conducted. Potential predictors of BMI change among patients after at least three years of ART exposure were examined using a multiple logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. ART regimens, duration of exposure to ART, and recipients' demographic and biomedical characteristics including the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus-related comorbidities (DRC), defined as any morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes as described in the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10-CM) codebook index, were investigated as potential predictors of overweight/obesity. Results: Twenty-nine percent of recipients were overweight, 16.6% had obesity of whom 2.4% were morbidly-obese at the last clinic visit. Overweight/obese recipients were more likely to be female, to have DRC and less likely to have CD4 count between 201 and 249 cells/mm(3). Neither the first-line nor the second-, third-line ART regimens predicted overweight/obesity better than the other and neither did the duration of exposure to ART. No significant linear trends were observed in the prevalence of overweight/obesity by the duration of exposure to ART.

Despite similar recombination patterns in many recombinants, no clearly supported circulating recombinant form (CRF) was found, there was limited evidence of the transmission of breakpoints, and the vast majority (153/164; 93 per cent) of the A1/D recombinants appear to be unique recombinant forms.

Data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL), including 39 cognitively normal individuals (aged 60-74 years), 7 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (aged 64-71 years), and 11 individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) (aged 55-74 years), were used as reference. Apart from more women, the AIBL cohort was demographically comparable with the HIV sample. Also, the AIBL PET data did not differ by sex. Cerebellum standardized uptake value ratio amyloid values within 22 regions of interest were estimated. In the HIV sample, apolipoprotein E (APOE) was available in 80%, CSF biomarkers in 60%, and 8-10 years of long-term health outcomes in 100%. RESULTS: HAND and the AIBL group with no cognitive deficits had similar amyloid deposition, which was lower than that in both the MCI and AD groups. At the individual level, one HAND case showed high amyloid deposition consistent with AD. This case also had a CSF-AD-like profile and an E4/E4 for APOE. Clinically, this case declined over 18 years with mild HAND symptoms first, followed by progressive memory decline 8-9 years after the study PET, then progression to severe dementia within 2-3 years, and lived a further 6 years. Another HAND case showed increased amyloid deposition restricted to the hippocampi. Two other HAND cases showed abnormally decreased amyloid in subcortical areas.

This cross-sectional study of 13 advanced KS (4 EnKS, 9 EpKS) patients and 3 healthy controls utilized single-color immunohistochemistry and dual-color immunofluorescence assays to characterize and quantify KSHV infected cells in relation to various TIIC in KS biopsies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences between groups where P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The abundance of KSHV infected cells was heterogeneous in KS biopsies. Despite the presence of T-cell chemoattractant chemokine CxCL-9 in biopsies, CD8(+) T-cells were sparsely distributed in regions with evident KSHV infected cells but were readily detectable in regions devoid of KSHV infected cells (P < 0.0001). CD68(+) (M1) macrophages were evenly and diffusely distributed in KS biopsies, whereas, the majority of CD163(+) (M2) macrophages were localized in regions devoid of KSHV infected cells (P < 0.0001).

Tanzania has a high burden of both HIV and cervical cancer, with an HIV prevalence of 5.5% in women in 2018, and a cervical cancer incidence rate among the highest globally, at 59.1 per 100,000 per year, and an estimated 9,772 cervical cancers diagnosed in 2018. We aimed to quantify the impact that interventions intended to control HIV have had and will have on cervical cancer in Tanzania over a period from 1995 to 2070. METHODS: A deterministic transmission-dynamic compartment model of HIV and HPV infection and natural history was used to simulate the impact of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and targeted pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on cervical cancer incidence and mortality from 1995-2070. FINDINGS: We estimate that VMMC has prevented 2,843 cervical cancer cases and 1,039 cervical cancer deaths from 1995-2020; by 2070 we predict that VMMC will have lowered cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates by 28% (55.11 cases per 100,000 women in 2070 without VMMC, compared to 39.93 with VMMC only) and 26% (37.31 deaths per 100,000 women in 2070 without VMMC compared to 27.72 with VMMC), respectively. We predict that ART will temporarily increase cervical cancer diagnoses and deaths, due to the removal of HIV death as a competing risk, but will ultimately further lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates by 7% (to 37.31 cases per 100,000 women in 2070) and 5% (to 26.44 deaths per 100,000 women in 2070), respectively, relative to a scenario with VMMC but no ART. A combination of ART and targeted PrEP use is anticipated to lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates to 35.82 and 25.35 cases and deaths, respectively, per 100,000 women in 2070. CONCLUSIONS: HIV treatment and control measures in Tanzania will result in long-term reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Although, in the near term, the life-extending capability of ART will result in a temporary increase in cervical cancer rates, continued efforts towards HIV prevention will reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality over the longer term.

Furthermore, 4 HIV-1 isolates (2.4%, 4/168) had surveillance drug-resistance mutation (SDRM), including 3 nonnucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) SDRMs (1 K101E, 2 K103N) and 1 protease inhibitor (PI) SDRM (M46I). The HIV viral diversity among blood donors observed in this study suggest that ongoing HIV-1 recombination is becoming progressively complex in China, and lots of DRMs found in the study exacerbate the primary drug resistance landscape, which highlight the necessity of timely genotypic drug resistance monitoring and molecular surveillance of HIV-1 among blood donors.')\n",

WHO publishes guidelines on HIV testing strategies that maximise the likelihood of correctly determining one's HIV status. A review of national HIV testing policies in 2014 found low adherence to WHO guidelines. We updated this review to determine adherence to current recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive policy review through April 2018. We extracted data on HIV testing strategies, recommendations on HIV retesting prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related HIV testing information. Descriptive analyses disaggregated by region were conducted to ascertain adherence to recommendations and to describe testing strategy characteristics. RESULTS: Of 91 policies included, 26% (n=24/91) adhered to WHO recommendations. Having a two-assay testing strategy to rule-in HIV infection as opposed to the recommended three-assay testing strategy was a major reason for non-adherence. Of 72 country policies providing sufficient information, 31% (n=22) recommended retesting for HIV prior to initiating ART. Of 25 countries and two regions reporting PrEP-related HIV testing guidelines, almost all recommended testing prior to initiating PrEP and every 3 months during PrEP use. CONCLUSIONS: Global adherence to WHO recommendations for HIV testing strategies have improved since 2014 but remain low. We found adherence existed on a continuum. Such a system provides insights into how countries can move towards adherence by making relatively minor changes to testing strategies. Guidance from WHO on the role of new HIV testing technologies within testing algorithms and identifying ways to simplify testing guidance is warranted.\")\n",

However, many HIV-positive women who interface with the health system continue to miss out on this information. We sought to: a) determine the proportion of HIV-positive women enrolled in HIV care who missed family planning (FP) counselling; and b) assess if any association existed between receipt of FP counselling and current use of modern contraception to inform programming. METHODS: Data were drawn from a quantitative national cross-sectional survey of 5198 HIV-positive women receiving HIV care at 245 HIV clinics in Uganda; conducted between August and November 2016. Family planning counselling was defined as provision of FP information (i.e. available FP methods and choices) to an HIV-positive woman by a health provider during ANC, at the time of delivery or at the PNC visit. Analyses on receipt of FP counselling were done on 2760 HIV-positive women aged 15-49 years who were not currently pregnant and did not intend to have children in the future. We used a modified Poisson regression model to determine the Prevalence Ratio (PR) as a measure of association between receipt of any FP counselling and current use of modern contraception, controlling for potential confounders. Analyses were performed using STATA statistical software, version 14.1. RESULTS: Overall, 2104 (76.2%) HIV-positive women reported that they received FP counselling at any of the three critical time-points. Of the 24% (n = 656) who did not, 37.9% missed FP counselling at ANC; 41% missed FP counselling during delivery; while 54% missed FP counselling at the post-natal care visit. HIV-positive women who received any FP counselling were significantly more likely to report current use of modern contraception than those who did not (adjusted PR [adj. PR] = 1.21; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.10, 1.33). CONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of HIV-positive women did not receive any form of FP counselling when they interfaced with the healthcare system. This presents a missed opportunity for prevention of unintended pregnancies, and suggests a need for the integration of FP counselling into HIV care at all critical time-points.')\n",

We examined preferences of HIV virologic control strategies by age groups. In 2018, we conducted a nationwide, online cross-sectional survey to examine differences in HIV virologic control strategies among a sample of people living with HIV who were <50 and >/=50 years of age. From a total of 281 participants, 3 findings were noteworthy: (1) Participants <50 years of age were more likely to be demotivated by perceived social risks (e.g., stigma, discrimination, HIV disclosure, and fear of transmitting HIV during a treatment interruption), compared with those >/=50 years; (2) participants >/=50 years of age were more motivated by altruistic notions compared with those <50 years; and (3) we noted greater desirability of longer long-acting ART and new HIV cure-related strategies among participants <50 years versus those >/=50 years.

The Deki Reader (Fio Corporation(R), Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a portable device designed specifically for analysing RDTs and was selected for evaluation in South Africa in the context of HIV RDT analysis. METHODS: This study consisted of a laboratory evaluation and two-part field evaluation of the Deki Reader v100, covering two RDT testing algorithms, and an evaluation of the continuous quality monitoring through the Fionet web portal. Based on user feedback from the field evaluation, the device underwent hardware and software redesign, and the Deki Reader v200 was evaluated in the laboratory. Ethics approval for this evaluation was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee: M150160. RESULTS: The intra- and inter-device laboratory precision of the Deki Reader v100 were 98.3 and 99.2% respectively, and 99.3 and 100% for the Deki Reader v200. The laboratory concordances compared to standard-of-care reporting were 99.5 and 98.0% for the two respective models, while sensitivity and specificity were 99.5 and 99.4% for the Deki Reader V100 and 100 and 93.1% for the Deki Reader V200 respectively.

We determine the rate and the free energy profile for the addition of a nucleotide to a DNA strand using a combination of a QM/MM model, the string method, and exact Milestoning. The barrier height and the time scale of the reaction are consistent with experiment. We show that the observables (free energies and mean first passage time) converge rapidly, as a function of the Milestoning iteration number. We also consider the substitution of an oxygen of the incoming nucleotide by a nonbridging sulfur atom and its impact on the enzymatic reaction. This substitution has been suggested in the past as a tool to examine the influence of the chemical step on the overall rate. Our joint computational and experimental study suggests that the impact of the substitution is small. Computationally, the differences between the two are within the estimated error bars. Experiments suggest a small difference. Finally, we examine step i, the weak binding of the nucleotide to the protein surface.

However, plants produce triterpenoids in low abundance, and their complex structures make their chemical synthesis prohibitively expensive and often impossible. As such, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been explored as an alternative means of production. An important triterpenoid is oleanolic acid because it is the precursor to many bioactive triterpenoids of commercial interest, such as QS-21 which is being evaluated as a vaccine adjuvant in clinical trials against HIV and malaria. Oleanolic acid is derived from 2,3-oxidosqualene (natively produced by yeast) via a cyclisation and a multi-step oxidation reaction, catalysed by a beta-amyrin synthase and a cytochrome P450 of the CYP716A subfamily, respectively. Although many homologues have been characterised, previous studies have used arbitrarily chosen beta-amyrin synthases and CYP716As to produce oleanolic acid and its derivatives in yeast. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of beta-amyrin synthase and CYP716A enzyme activities in yeast.

Hepatic steatosis (>/=5%) was defined by liver biopsy or controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement during vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). (3) Results: A total of 151 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy and direct-acting antiviral therapy were included in this analysis. Prevalence of steatosis by liver biopsy (n = 34) or CAP (>/=263 db/m) during VCTE (n = 92) was 27% and was independently associated with obesity (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.43-6.82; p = 0.004) and the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-0.15; p = 0.01). The overall SVR rate (n = 148) was 95% and was not impacted by the presence of steatosis (p = 0.42). (4) Conclusions: Hepatic steatosis is common in HIV-HCV coinfection, correlates with obesity and the metabolic syndrome and does not impact SVR.')\n",

We collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 272 children with retinopathy-negative or retinopathy-positive CM and selected CSF from 111 of these children (38 retinopathy positive, 71 retinopathy negative, 2 retinopathy unknown) for analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. We found CSF viral coinfections in 7/38 (18.4%) retinopathy-positive children and in 18/71 (25.4%) retinopathy-negative children. Excluding HIV-1, human herpesviruses (HHV) represented 61% of viruses identified. Excluding HIV-1, CNS viral coinfection was equally likely in children who were retinopathy positive and retinopathy negative (P = 0.1431). Neither mortality nor neurological morbidity was associated with the presence of virus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.276, 95% CI: 0.056-1.363). Retinopathy-negative children with a higher temperature, lower white blood cell count, or being dehydrated were more likely to have viral coinfection. Level of consciousness at admission was not associated with CNS viral coinfection in retinopathy-negative children. Viral CNS coinfection is unlikely to contribute to coma in children with CM. The herpesviruses other than herpes simplex virus may represent incidental bystanders in CM, reactivating during acute malaria infection.')\n",

Maturation inhibitors such as bevirimat (BVM) bind within six-helix bundles, formed by a segment that spans the junction between the CA and spacer peptide 1 (SP1) subunits of Gag, and interfere with cleavage between CA and SP1 catalyzed by the HIV-1 protease (PR). We report solid-state NMR (ssNMR) measurements on spherical virus-like particles (VLPs), facilitated by segmental isotopic labeling, that provide information about effects of BVM on the structure and dynamics of CA-SP1 junction helices in the immature lattice. Although BVM strongly blocks PR-catalyzed CA-SP1 cleavage in VLPs and blocks conversion of VLPs to tubular CA assemblies, (15)N and (13)C ssNMR chemical shifts of segmentally labeled VLPs with and without BVM are very similar, indicating that interaction with BVM does not alter the six-helix bundle structure appreciably. Only the (15)N chemical shift of A280 (the first residue of SP1) changes significantly, consistent with BVM binding to an internal ring of hydrophobic side chains of L279 residues. Measurements of transverse (15)N spin relaxation rates reveal a reduction in the amplitudes and/or timescales of backbone N-H bond motions, corresponding to a rigidification of the six-helix bundles. Overall, our data show that inhibition of HIV-1 maturation by BVM involves changes in structure and dynamics that are surprisingly subtle, but still sufficient to produce a large effect on CA-SP1 cleavage.')\n",

However, this cut-off is conservative and arbitrarily defined. Data is lacking on the natural history, response to therapy and survival of patients diagnosed with precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) with mild or borderline elevation of PVR.In Australia, PAH therapy could be prescribed solely on mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) criteria. Using the Australian and New Zealand Pulmonary Hypertension Registry, we aimed to study a population diagnosed with PAH between January 2004 and December 2017 with the pre-defined haemodynamic characteristics of mean PAP >/=25 mmHg, PAWP </=15 mmHg and PVR <3 Wood units.Eighty-two patients met the pre-defined haemodynamic inclusion criteria (mean age 63+/-11 years; 67 females). Underlying aetiologies included idiopathic disease (n=39), connective tissue disease (CTD; n=42) and HIV infection (n=1). At diagnosis, mean PAP was 27 mmHg (interquartile range (IQR) 25-30 mmHg), PAWP 13 mmHg (IQR 11-14 mmHg) and PVR 2.2 Wood units (IQR 1.9-2.7 Wood units). Baseline 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was 352 m (IQR 280-416 m) and 77% of subjects were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 3 or 4. All patients were commenced on initial monotherapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA; n=66) or phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5i; n=16). At first re-evaluation, 6MWD increased by 46 m (IQR 7-96 m) and 35% of subjects demonstrated improvement in NYHA functional class. After a median follow-up of 65 months (IQR 32-101 months), 18 out of 82 subjects (22.0%) had died, with estimated 1-year and 5-year survival rates of 98% and 84%, respectively. Death attributed to PAH occurred in six out of these 18 patients (33.3%, 7% of total cohort).Patients with precapillary PH and \"borderline\" PVR falling outside the current definition have adverse outcomes. Such patients appear to respond to PAH therapy; however, this requires further study in randomised trials.')\n",

health trends has shown that injuries form a substantial burden of population health loss. Regular updates to injury burden assessments are critical. We report Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Study estimates on morbidity and mortality for all injuries. METHODS: We reviewed results for injuries from the GBD 2017 study. GBD 2017 measured injury-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. To measure non-fatal injuries, GBD 2017 modelled injury-specific incidence and converted this to prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs). YLLs and YLDs were summed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). FINDINGS: In 1990, there were 4 260 493 (4 085 700 to 4 396 138) injury deaths, which increased to 4 484 722 (4 332 010 to 4 585 554) deaths in 2017, while age-standardised mortality decreased from 1079 (1073 to 1086) to 738 (730 to 745) per 100 000. In 1990, there were 354 064 302 (95% uncertainty interval: 338 174 876 to 371 610 802) new cases of injury globally, which increased to 520 710 288 (493 430 247 to 547 988 635) new cases in 2017. During this time, age-standardised incidence decreased non-significantly from 6824 (6534 to 7147) to 6763 (6412 to 7118) per 100 000. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALYs decreased from 4947 (4655 to 5233) per 100 000 to 3267 (3058 to 3505). INTERPRETATION: Injuries are an important cause of health loss globally, though mortality has declined between 1990 and 2017. Future research in injury burden should focus on prevention in high-burden populations, improving data collection and ensuring access to medical care.')\n",

The burden of HIV infection, a major risk factor for mortality among patients with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), has reduced due to concerted prevention and treatment strategies. None the less, anecdotal reports from the malnutrition unit at Uganda's National Referral Hospital (NRH) indicate that there is high mortality among patients with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in routine care. Uganda has recently adopted the revised World Health Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines for SAM to improve outcomes. The mortality among children with SAM in routine care has not been recently elucidated. We report the magnitude and factors associated with mortality among children under 5 years of age admitted to the NRH for routine care of SAM. METHODS: This was a cohort study of all severely malnourished children admitted to the NRH between June and October 2017. The primary outcome was two-week mortality. Mortality was calculated using simple proportions and Cox regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with time to mortality. Data was entered into Epidata and analysed using Stata v14. RESULTS: Two-hundred-sixty (98.5%) children: 59.6% male; mean age 14.4 (SD 9.4) months, completed two weeks of follow-up. Of these, 25.2% (95% CI 19.9-30.4%) died. In-hospital mortality was 20.7% (95% CI15.9-25.6%). The prevalence of HIV infection was 12.2%. Factors associated with mortality included: positive HIV status (AHR 2.2, (95% CI; 1.2-4.2), p = 0.014), bacteraemia (AHR 9 (95% CI 3.4-23.0), p < 0.001, and low glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), AHR 3.2; (95% CI 1.7-6.3), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 25% mortality among children with severe malnutrition remains unacceptably high despite significant reduction in HIV prevalence. Children with SAM who are HIV infected, have eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) or have bacteraemia, are more likely to die. Further studies to explore the relationship between eGFR and mortality among children with SAM are needed. Studies to establish efficacious antibiotics are urgently required to inform treatment guidelines for children with SAM.\")\n",

Yet a commensurate response to systematically tackle stigma within country responses has not yet occurred, which may be due to the lack of sufficient evidence documenting evaluated stigma-reduction interventions. With stigma present in all life spheres, health facilities offer a logical starting point for developing and expanding stigma reduction interventions. This study evaluates the impact of a \"total facility\" stigma-reduction intervention on the drivers and manifestations of stigma and discrimination among health facility staff in Ghana. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of a total facility stigma-reduction intervention by comparing five intervention to five comparable non-intervention health facilities in Ghana. Interventions began in September 2017. Data collection was in June 2017 and April 2018. The primary outcomes were composite indicators for three stigma drivers, self-reported stigmatizing avoidance behaviour, and observed discrimination. The principal intervention variable was whether the respondent worked at an intervention or comparison facility. We estimated intervention effects as differences-in-differences in each outcome, further adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: We observed favourable intervention effects for all outcome domains except for stigmatizing attitudes. Preferring not to provide services to people living with HIV (PLHIV) or a key population member improved 11.1% more in intervention than comparison facility respondents (95% CI 3.2 to 19.0). Other significant improvements included knowledge of policies to protect against discrimination (difference-in-differences = 20.4%; 95% CI 12.7 to 28.0); belief that discrimination would be punished (11.2%; 95% CI 0.2 to 22.3); and knowledge of and belief in the adequacy of infection control policies (17.6%; 95% CI 8.3 to 26.9). Reported observation of stigma and discrimination incidents fell by 7.4 percentage points more among intervention than comparison facility respondents, though only marginally significant in the IPTW-adjusted model (p = 0.06). Respondents at intervention facilities were 19.0% (95% CI 12.2 to 25.8) more likely to report that staff behaviour towards PLHIV had improved over the last year than those at comparison facilities. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a foundation for scaling up health facility stigma-reduction within national HIV responses, though they should be accompanied by rigorous implementation science to ensure ongoing learning and adaptation for maximum effectiveness and long-term impact.')\n",

In people living with HIV (PLWH), several lines of evidence suggest that a depletion of gut CD4 T-cells is associated with gut dysbiosis, microbial translocation and systemic inflammation. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly controls viral replication, which leads to CD4 T-cell recovery and control of the disease. However, gut dysbiosis, epithelial damage and microbial translocation persist despite ART, increasing risk of developing inflammatory non-AIDS comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, liver steatosis and cancer. In addition to ART, an emerging research priority is to discover strategies to improve the gut microbial composition and intestinal barrier function. Probiotic interventions have been extensively used with controversial benefits in humans. Encouragingly, within the last decade, the intestinal symbiotic bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila has emerged as the \"sentinel of the gut.\" A lower abundance of A. muciniphila has been shown in diabetic and obese people as well as in PLWH. Interventions with high levels of polyphenols such as tea or diets rich in fruit, the antibiotic vancomycin and the antidiabetic drug metformin have been shown to increase A. muciniphila abundance, contributing to improved metabolic function in diabetic and obese individuals. We hypothesize that gut microbiota rich in A. muciniphila can reduce microbial translocation and inflammation, preventing occurrences of non-AIDS comorbidities in PLWH. To this aim, we will discuss the protective effect of A. muciniphila and its potential applications, paving the way toward novel therapeutic strategies to improve gut health in PLWH.')\n",

We further applied the birth-death skyline model to the sequences from Odessa (n = 275) and Kyiv (n = 92) in order to estimate changes in the epidemic's effective reproductive number (Re) and rate of becoming uninfectious (delta). We identified 12 transmission clusters in Odessa; phylogenetic clustering was correlated with younger age and higher average viral load at the time of sampling. Estimated Re were similar in Odessa and Kyiv before the initiation of TRIP; Re started to decline in 2013 and is now below Re = 1 in Odessa (Re = 0.4, 95%HPD 0.06-0.75), but not in Kyiv (Re = 2.3, 95%HPD 0.2-5.4). Similarly, estimates of delta increased in Odessa after the initiation of TRIP.

We assessed outcomes by ICD-10 codes in electronic medical records (EMR) of 4402 transgender patients. Hormone use was assessed both by blood concentrations and by prescriptions, from EMR. Results: Nineteen transwomen (TW) (0.8%) had a TE and 49 (2.1%) developed HTN; among transmen (TM), 27 (1.5%) developed HTN and there were no significant associations between hormones and HTN. Among transwomen, there was no association between TE and HT as assessed by blood concentrations. However, recent progestin prescriptions were associated with an increased odds of TE (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.95 [95% confidence interval; CI 1.02-8.57]), with possibly differential effects for medroxyprogesterone acetate versus micronized progesterone. Higher total testosterone blood concentrations were associated with greater odds of HTN in TW (aOR 1.16 [95% CI 1.01-1.33]), after controlling for body mass index.

ZnF-dependent and Zinc (Zn(2+))-chelation-sensitive NC-LLPS are formed in live cells. NC-Zn(2+) ejection reverses the HIV-1 blockade on SG assembly, inhibits NC-SG assembly, disrupts NC/Gag-genomic RNA (vRNA) ribonucleoprotein complexes, and causes nuclear sequestration of NC and the vRNA, inhibiting Gag expression and virus release.

METHODS: We conducted a time and motion (TAM) study between January 2018 and March 2019, in which consenting HCWs were observed throughout a typical workday. The precise time spent was recorded in pre-specified categories of work activities for each step along the cascade. A linear mixed model was fit to estimate the time at each step.

Ten clinics in upstate New York and Long Island participated in the study. HIV screening was performed using the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test. 14,887 dental patients were offered HIV screening tests; 9,057 (60.8%) were screened; and one patient (0.011%) was confirmed HIV positive and linked to medical care. Of all dental patients, 33% had never been screened for HIV; and 56% had not had a primary care visit or had not been offered an HIV screening test by primary care providers in the previous 12 months. Multi-level generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that test acceptance was significantly associated with patient's age, race/ethnicity, gender, country of origin, primary payer (or insurance), past primary care visits, past HIV testing experiences, and the poverty level of patient's community. HIV screening is well accepted by dental patients and can be effectively integrated into routine dental care. HIV screening in the dental setting can be a good option for first-time testers, those who have not seen a primary care provider in the last 12 months, and those who have not been offered HIV screening at their last primary care visit.\")\n",

Here we describe a xeno-nucleic acid system based on alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleic acid (TNA) that is completely refractory to nuclease digestion. The use of an engineered TNA polymerase permitted the isolation of functional TNA aptamers that bind to HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) with KD's of approximately 0.4-4.0 nM. The aptamers were identified using a display strategy that provides a powerful genotype-phenotype linkage. The TNA aptamers remain active in the presence of nuclease and exhibit markedly higher thermal stability than monoclonal antibodies. The combined properties of biological stability, high binding affinity, and thermal stability make TNA aptamers a powerful system for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.\")\n",

One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.')\n",

RESULTS: 190 ambulatory PLWH recruited to the main study, 143 were included in the analysis (38 had no stored DNA and 9 no T-lymphocyte subpopulation). Of 143 included, the median age (IQR) was 45(39-48) years, 64% were male and 66% were of Caucasian ethnicity.

METHODS: Adult, treatment-naive PWH in NA-ACCORD initiating integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART on/after 1 January 2007 were followed through 31 December 2016. Multivariate linear mixed effects models estimated weight up to five years after ART initiation, adjusting for age, sex, race, cohort site, HIV acquisition mode, treatment year, and baseline weight, plasma HIV-1 RNA level and CD4(+) cell count. Due to shorter follow-up for PWH receiving newer INSTI drugs, weights for specific INSTIs were estimated at two years. Secondary analyses using logistic regression and all covariates from primary analyses assessed factors associated with >10% weight gain at two and five years. RESULTS: Among 22,972 participants, 87% were male, and 41% were white. 49% started NNRTI-, 31% started PI- and 20% started INSTI-based regimens (1624 raltegravir (RAL), 2085 elvitegravir (EVG) and 929 dolutegravir (DTG)).

In lymph nodes, dual CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade, but not PD-1 alone, decreased the total and intact SIV-DNA in CD4(+) T cells, and SIV-DNA and SIV-RNA in B cell follicles, a major site of viral persistence during ART. None of the tested interventions enhanced SIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses during ART or viral control after ART interruption. Thus, despite CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade inducing robust latency reversal and reducing total levels of integrated virus, the degree of reservoir clearance was still insufficient to achieve viral control.

However, its measurement invariance, or the degree to which observed scores can be meaningfully compared across racial/ethnic groups, has not been established. Methods: The 10-item Index is a self-report measure initially validated in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems cohort study. Using Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems survey data, Index scores were linked to patients' electronic medical records, which included viral load (VL) and appointment attendance data. We conducted measurement invariance analyses to test the Index's performance in the 3 racial/ethnic groups and its cross-sectional association with VL and retention in HIV care (2 primary outcomes). Results: A total of 3,127 patients completed the Index, which showed good reliability across the 3 groups (alphas >.84). Confirmatory factor analysis model fit statistics showed that the Index demonstrated configural, metric, and scalar invariance, supporting the conclusion that the Index is a single factor construct. Lastly, lower Index scores associated with a concurrent detectable VL and poor retention in HIV care for all 3 groups.

Past studies suggest that this association may be due to the tendency for intoxication to interfere with condom use. However, research on potential causal mechanisms explaining this relationship has been limited primarily to laboratory studies. In this study, we tested several potential mediators of the relationship between alcohol use level and HIV risk behavior. DESIGN: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods conducted over a 30-day period. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS/CASES: MSM (n = 100) in the northeastern United States. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed daily diary surveys and up to six experience sampling surveys randomly prompted throughout the day. FINDINGS: Very heavy levels of drinking (12+ drinks) increased the odds of engaging in any sex [odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, P < 0.001]. Coefficient products and 95% confidence intervals indicated that both subjective sexual arousal (OR = 1.52, P < 0.001) and sex intentions (OR = 1.74, P < 0.001) significantly mediated the association between very heavy drinking and the odds of sex. When participants reported sex, the odds of engaging in high-risk condomless anal sex (CAS) increased incrementally after drinking heavily (five to 11 drinks; OR = 3.27, P = 0.006) and very heavily (12+ drinks; OR = 4.42, P < 0.001). Only subjective sexual arousal significantly mediated the association between alcohol use level and high-risk CAS (OR = 1.16, P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in subjective sexual arousal after drinking heavily appear to partly account for alcohol-related HIV risk behaviors in the daily lives of men who have sex with men. Alcohol's role in strengthening motivationally consistent emotional states may therefore play a more important role in facilitating alcohol-involved HIV risk than explicit sexual motivation.\")\n",

However, it is underreported in African populations. Copy number variants (CNVs) could have important impacts on disease susceptibility and environmental adaptation. To describe CNVs and their possible impacts in Africans, we sequenced genomes of 232 individuals from three major African ethno-linguistic groups: (1) Niger Congo A from Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, (2) Niger Congo B from Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo and (3) Nilo-Saharans from Uganda. We used GenomeSTRiP and cn.MOPS to identify copy number variant regions (CNVRs). RESULTS: We detected 7608 CNVRs, of which 2172 were only deletions, 2384 were only insertions and 3052 had both. We detected 224 previously un-described CNVRs. The majority of novel CNVRs were present at low frequency and were not shared between populations. We tested for evidence of selection associated with CNVs and also for population structure. Signatures of selection identified previously, using SNPs from the same populations, were overrepresented in CNVRs. When CNVs were tagged with SNP haplotypes to identify SNPs that could predict the presence of CNVs, we identified haplotypes tagging 3096 CNVRs, 372 CNVRs had SNPs with evidence of selection (iHS > 3) and 222 CNVRs had both. This was more than expected (p < 0.0001) and included loci where CNVs have previously been associated with HIV, Rhesus D and preeclampsia. When integrated with 1000 Genomes CNV data, we replicated their observation of population stratification by continent but no clustering by populations within Africa, despite inclusion of Nilo-Saharans and Niger-Congo populations within our dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Novel CNVRs in the current study increase representation of African diversity in the database of genomic variants. Over-representation of CNVRs in SNP signatures of selection and an excess of SNPs that both tag CNVs and are subject to selection show that CNVs may be the actual targets of selection at some loci. However, unlike SNPs, CNVs alone do not resolve African ethno-linguistic groups. Tag haplotypes for CNVs identified may be useful in predicting African CNVs in future studies where only SNP data is available.\")\n",

Structurally defined mimics of native trimeric Env glycoproteins (e.g., SOSIP trimers) present multiple epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and their germline precursors, but elicitation of bNAbs remains elusive. Here, we argue that the interactions between Env and the immune system render it exceptional among viral vaccine antigens and hinder its immunogenicity in absolute and comparative terms. In other words, Env binds to CD4 on key immune cells and transduces signals that can compromise their function. Moreover, the extensive array of oligomannose glycans on Env shields peptidic B cell epitopes, impedes the presentation of T helper cell epitopes, and attracts mannose binding proteins, which could affect the antibody response. We suggest lines of research for assessing how to overcome obstacles that the exceptional features of Env impose on the creation of a successful HIV-1 vaccine.')\n",

Additionally, we compared the modelled impact of a standardised screening programme to results obtained from other published mathematical models of chlamydia screening. RESULTS: All strategies resulted in reductions in general and targeted population chlamydia and gonorrhoea transmission. Opportunistic screening of patients in youth and HIV care was shown to be the most effective, and FSW screening was shown to be the most efficient strategy. Differences between models could be attributed to differences in the modelled heterogeneity in sexual behaviour as well as differences in assumptions about immunity following chlamydia recovery.

We set out to determine PrEP eligibility, uptake and predictors of PrEP uptake among MSM enrolled in an HIV-1 vaccine feasibility cohort in coastal Kenya. Methods: We compared the number of MSM identified as eligible for PrEP from June-December 2017 by Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) criteria, which do not include reported anal intercourse, to those identified as eligible by a published MSM cohort-derived HIV-1 risk score (CDHRS). We determined PrEP uptake and assessed factors associated with uptake at first offer among eligible MSM followed up monthly. Results: Out of 167 MSM assessed for PrEP eligibility, 118 (70.7%) were identified by both MoH and CDHRS eligibility criteria; 33 (19.8%) by CDHRS alone, 11 (6.6%) by MoH criteria alone, and 5 (3.0%) by neither criterion. Of the men identified by CDHRS alone, the majority (24 or 72.7%) reported receptive anal intercourse (RAI). Of the 162 MSM eligible for PrEP, 113 (69.7%) accepted PrEP at first offer.

Conclusions: Assessing PrEP eligibility using the CDHRS identified 20% more at-risk MSM for PrEP initiation than when Kenyan MoH criteria were used. Approximately 70% of eligible men accepted PrEP at first offer, suggesting that PrEP is acceptable among at-risk MSM. MSM reporting RAI, group sex, or paying for sex were more likely to accept PrEP.

The modified sites on the HIV-1 RT were examined using a mass spectrometry approach, and it was discovered that the azauracil moieties modified the enzyme in proximity to its active site. However, these scaffolds gave little or no inhibition of enzyme activity. Instead, a bifunctional inhibitor was prepared using click chemistry to link the 6-azauracil moiety to azidothymidine (AzT) and the corresponding triphosphate (AzTTP). These bifunctional inhibitors were found to have potent inhibitory function through a mode of action that includes both alkylation and chain termination. An in vitro assay demonstrated that the bifunctional inhibitor was 23-fold more effective in inhibiting HIV-1 RT activity than the parent AzTTP. The bifunctional inhibitor was also tested in HIV-1 permissive T cells where it decreased Gag expression similarly to the front-line drug Efavirenz with no evidence of cytotoxicity.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for human papillomavirus (HPV) E4 protein indicates CIN with productive HPV infection, whereas Ki-67 and p16(ink4a) indicate CIN with transforming characteristics, which may be further characterized using DNA hypermethylation, indicative for advanced transforming CIN. Cervical biopsies (n = 175) from 102 HPV positive women living with HIV were independently reviewed by three expert pathologists. The consensus CIN grade was used as reference standard. IHC staining patterns were scored for Ki-67 (0-3), p16(ink4a) (0-3), and E4 (0-2) and correlated to methylation levels of four cellular genes in corresponding cervical scrapes. Reference standards and immunoscores were obtained from 165 biopsies:15 no dysplasia, 91 CIN1, 31 CIN2, and 28 CIN3. Ki-67 and p16(ink4a) scores increased with increasing CIN grade, while E4 positivity was highest in CIN1 and CIN2 lesions. E4 positive CIN1 lesions had higher Ki-67 and p16(ink4a) scores and higher methylation levels compared with E4 negative CIN1 lesions. E4 positive biopsies with low cumulative Ki-67/p16 (ink4a) immunoscores (0-3) had significantly higher methylation levels compared with E4 negative biopsies. No significant differences in Ki-67 and p16(ink4a) scores and methylation levels were observed between E4 negative and positive CIN2 or CIN3 lesions. The presence of high methylation levels in scrapes of CIN lesions with IHC characteristics of both productive (E4 positive) and transforming infections (increased Ki-67/p16(ink4a) expression) in women living with HIV might indicate a rapid aggressive course of HPV infections towards cancer in these women.')\n",

The country's pediatric case finding strategy uses global best practices of index testing, provider-initiated counselling and testing, and targeted community testing of at-risk populations to find about 50,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) who are undiagnosed. However, context-specific strategies are necessary to find the hidden children to meet the full 90% target. This study assesses whether sex of the caregiver is associated with HIV status of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as a valuable strategy for enhanced pediatric case findings. METHODS: Data originate from the community-based, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kizazi Kipya Project, which works towards increasing OVC's and their caregivers' uptake of HIV/AIDS and other health and social services in Tanzania. Included in this study are 39,578 OVC ages 0-19 years who the project enrolled during January through March 2017 in 18 regions of Tanzania and who voluntarily reported their HIV status. Data analysis involved multi-level logistic regression, with OVC HIV status as the outcome of interest and caregiver's sex as the main independent variable. RESULTS: Three-quarters (74.3%) of the OVC included in the study had female caregivers, and their overall HIV prevalence was 7.1%. The prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among OVC with male caregivers (7.8%) than among OVC with female caregivers (6.8%), and indeed, multivariate analysis showed that OVC with male caregivers were significantly 40% more likely to be HIV-positive than those with female caregivers (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.83). This effect was the strongest among 0-4 year-olds (OR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.61-10.03), declined to 1.72 among 5-9 year-olds (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.93), and lost significance for children over age 9 years. Other significant factors included OVC age and nutritional status; caregiver HIV status and marital status; household health insurance status, and family size; and rural versus urban residence. CONCLUSIONS: OVC in Tanzania with male caregivers have a 40% higher likelihood of being HIV-positive than those with female caregivers. HIV risk assessment activities should target OVC with male caregivers, as well as OVC who have malnutrition, HIV-positive caregivers, or caregivers who do not disclose their HIV status to community volunteers. Further, younger HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in rural areas, while older HIV-positive OVC are more likely to live in urban areas. These factors should be integrated in HIV risk assessment algorithms to enhance HIV testing yields and pediatric case-finding in the OVC population in Tanzania.\")\n",

Changes arise at a variable pace governed by time-dependent and -independent mechanisms that are themselves complex, interdependent and variable. Molecular decay produces inferior cells that eventually dominate over healthy counterparts in tissues they comprise. In a form of biological entropy, progression from molecular through cellular to tissue level degeneration culminates in organ disease or dysfunction, affecting systemic health. To better understand time-independent contributors and their potential modulation, common biophysical bases for key molecular and cellular changes underlying age-related physiological deterioration must be delineated. This review addresses the potential contribution of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven T cell proliferation to cellular senescence and immunosenescence. We first describe molecular processes imposing cell cycle arrest, the foundation of cellular senescence, then focus on the unique distribution, phenotype and function of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the context of cellular senescence and \"inflammaging\". Their features position CMV infection as a pathogenic accelerant of immune cell proliferation underlying immune senescence. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, where increased inflammation and exaggerated anti-CMV immune responses accelerate immune senescence, CMV infection has emerged as a major factor in unhealthy aging. Thus, we speculate on mechanistic links between CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell expansion, immune senescence and prevalence of age-related disorders in HIV infection.')\n",

The Visitect CD4 Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) is a disposable POC test, providing a visually interpreted result of above or below 200 CD4cells/mm3. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of this index test. METHODS: Consenting patients above 18years of age and eligible for CD4 testing were enrolled in Nsanje district hospital (Malawi), Gutu mission hospital (Zimbabwe) and Centre hopitalier de Kabinda (DRC). A total of 708 venous blood samples were tested in the index test and in the BD FACSCount assay (reference test method) in the laboratories (Phase 1) to determine diagnostic accuracy. A total of 433 finger-prick (FP) samples were tested on the index test at POC by clinicians (Phase 2) and a self-completed questionnaire was administered to all testers to explore usability of the index test. RESULTS: Among 708 patients, 67.2% were female and median CD4 was 297cells/mm3. The sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA using venous blood in the laboratory was 95.0% [95% CI: 91.3-97.5] and specificity was 81.9% [95% CI: 78.2-85.2%]. Using FP samples, the sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA was 98.3% [95% CI: 95.0-99.6] and specificity was 77.2% [95% CI: 71.6-82.2%]. Usability of the Visitect CD4 LFA was high across the study sites with 97% successfully completed tests. Due to the required specific multiple incubation and procedural steps during the Visitect CD4 LFA testing, few health workers (7/26) were not confident to manage testing whilst multi-tasking in their clinical work. CONCLUSIONS: Visitect CD4 LFA is a promising test for decentralized CD4 screening in resource-limited settings, without access to CD4 testing and and it can trigger prompt management of patients with AHD. Lay health cadres should be considered to conduct Visitect CD4 LFA testing in PHCs as well as coordinating all other POC quality assurance.')\n",

Traditional machismo is characterized by aggressiveness/power; caballerismo consists of family values/chivalry. Latino SMM high in traditional machismo may avoid seeking Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent being stigmatized as effeminate. Latino SMM high in caballerismo may be more likely to use PrEP to remain healthy for their family and/or partners. The current study explored the association between traditional machismo and caballerismo with four steps of the PrEP cascade. Participants were 151 HIV-negative/unknown Latino SMM living in San Diego, California (M = 24.18 years old) who completed an online study. Traditional machismo was associated with low odds of PrEP awareness, willingness, and adherence and high odds of PrEP use. Caballerismo was associated with greater odds of PrEP awareness, willingness, use, and adherence. High levels of traditional machismo among Latino SMM may be a barrier to PrEP. Caballerismo may be a facilitator of PrEP awareness, willingness, use, and adherence. Programs which serve to move Latino SMM through the PrEP cascade may benefit from discussing culturally-relevant masculinity given the potential for their differential associations with PrEP variables.')\n",

In collaboration with communities of transgender women of colour, TURNNT aims to explore the complex social and environmental (ie, neighbourhood) structures that affect HIV prevention and other aspects of health in order to identify avenues for intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSES: TURNNT is a prospective cohort study, which will recruit 300 transgender women of colour (150 Black/African American, 100 Latina and 50 Asian/Pacific Islander participants) in New York City. There will be three waves of data collection separated by 6 months. At each wave, participants will provide information on their relationships, social and sexual networks, and neighbourhoods. Global position system technology will be used to generate individual daily path areas in order to estimate neighbourhood-level exposures. Multivariate analyses will be conducted to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal, independent and synergistic associations of personal relationships (notably individual social capital), social and sexual networks, and neighbourhood factors (notably neighbourhood-level social cohesion) with PrEP uptake and discontinuation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The TURNNT protocol was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board (reference no. AAAS8164). This study will provide novel insights into the relationship, network and neighbourhood factors that influence HIV prevention behaviours among transgender women of colour and facilitate exploration of this population's health and well-being more broadly.

We qualitatively examined how relationship context influences perceptions of PrEP and decisions to initiate and discontinue PrEP among young Black MSM to provide a nuanced understanding of PrEP use within relationships. Between late 2017 and mid-2018, we conducted 10 focus groups with young Black MSM (n = 80) in Milwaukee, WI, Minneapolis, MN, Kansas City, KS, and Detroit, MI. We used inductive thematic analysis to examine how young Black MSM make decisions about PrEP use within the context of primary relationships. We identified three primary themes: (1) perceptions of PrEP as an indication of distrust and infidelity, (2) perceptions of PrEP use as necessary, even in primary relationships, and (3) the influence of partners on PrEP. Our results demonstrate the considerable variation in how young Black MSM view PrEP within primary relationships and the influence of primary partners in PrEP use decisions. The dynamics between two or more individuals can shape an individual's conceptualizations of and decisions around PrEP use, and these may be key drivers of racial disparities in HIV and PrEP use.\")\n",

STUDY SELECTION: Randomised trials that enrolled adults (>/=18 years) who were overweight (body mass index 25-29) or obese (>/=30) to a popular named diet or an alternative diet. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in body weight, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and C reactive protein at the six and 12 month follow-up. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study participants, interventions, and outcomes and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) approach. A bayesian framework informed a series of random effects network meta-analyses to estimate the relative effectiveness of the diets. RESULTS: 121 eligible trials with 21 942 patients were included and reported on 14 named diets and three control diets. Compared with usual diet, low carbohydrate and low fat diets had a similar effect at six months on weight loss (4.63 v 4.37 kg, both moderate certainty) and reduction in systolic blood pressure (5.14 mm Hg, moderate certainty v 5.05 mm Hg, low certainty) and diastolic blood pressure (3.21 v 2.85 mm Hg, both low certainty). Moderate macronutrient diets resulted in slightly less weight loss and blood pressure reductions. Low carbohydrate diets had less effect than low fat diets and moderate macronutrient diets on reduction in LDL cholesterol (1.01 mg/dL, low certainty v 7.08 mg/dL, moderate certainty v 5.22 mg/dL, moderate certainty, respectively) but an increase in HDL cholesterol (2.31 mg/dL, low certainty), whereas low fat (-1.88 mg/dL, moderate certainty) and moderate macronutrient (-0.89 mg/dL, moderate certainty) did not. Among popular named diets, those with the largest effect on weight reduction and blood pressure in comparison with usual diet were Atkins (weight 5.5 kg, systolic blood pressure 5.1 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 3.3 mm Hg), DASH (3.6 kg, 4.7 mm Hg, 2.9 mm Hg, respectively), and Zone (4.1 kg, 3.5 mm Hg, 2.3 mm Hg, respectively) at six months (all moderate certainty). No diets significantly improved levels of HDL cholesterol or C reactive protein at six months. Overall, weight loss diminished at 12 months among all macronutrient patterns and popular named diets, while the benefits for cardiovascular risk factors of all interventions, except the Mediterranean diet, essentially disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence shows that most macronutrient diets, over six months, result in modest weight loss and substantial improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, particularly blood pressure.

Researchers and ethics regulators have a duty to protect adolescents-as a special category of human subjects, they must have protection that extends beyond those afforded to all human subjects. Typically, additional protection includes parental consent for enrollment. However, parental consent can present a risk of harm for minor adolescents. Research involving minor adolescents indicate that they are unwilling to join biomedical trials for stigmatized health problems, such as HIV, when parental consent is required. This presents a significant barrier to progress in adolescent HIV prevention by creating delays in research and the translation of new scientific evidence generated in biomedical trials in adult populations. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to examine how parental involvement in the consent process affects the acceptability of hypothetical participation in biomedical HIV prevention trials from the perspectives of minor adolescents and parents of minor adolescents. METHODS: In this protocol, we use a quasi-experimental design that involves a simulated consent process for 2 different HIV prevention trials. The first trial is modeled after an open-label study of the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine as preexposure prophylaxis for HIV. The second trial is modeled after a phase IIa trial of an injectable HIV integrase inhibitor. There are 2 groups in the study-minor adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, inclusive, and parents of minor adolescents in the same age range. The adolescent participants are randomized to 1 of 3 consent conditions with varying degrees of parental involvement. After undergoing a simulated consent process, they rate their willingness to participate (WTP) in each of the 2 trials if offered the opportunity. The primary outcome is WTP, given the consent condition. Parents undergo a similar process but are asked to rate the acceptability of each of the 3 consent conditions. The primary outcome is acceptability of the consent method for enrollment. The secondary outcomes include the following: capacity to consent among both participant groups, the prevalence of medical mistrust, and the effects of the study phase (eg, phase IIa vs the open-label study) and drug administration route (eg, oral vs injection) on WTP (adolescents) and acceptability (parents) of the consent method. RESULTS: Enrollment began in April 2018 and ended mid-September 2019. Data are being analyzed and dissemination is expected in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The study will provide the needed empirical data about minor adolescents' and parents' perspectives on consent methods for minors. The evidence generated can be used to guide investigators and ethics regulators in the design of consent processes for biomedical HIV prevention trials.

We investigated how accounting for sampling, interview non-response and non-provision of biological samples affects prevalence estimates in the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3). METHODS: Natsal-3 was a multistage, clustered and stratified probability sample of 16-74 year-olds conducted between 2010 and 2012. Individuals were sampled from all private residential addresses in Britain; respondents aged 16-44 were further sampled to provide a urine specimen based on characteristics including self-reported sexual behaviours. We generated prevalence estimates and confidence intervals for six STIs in five stages: first without accounting for sampling or non-response, then applying inverse-probability weights cumulatively accounting for interview sampling, interview non-response, urine sampling and urine non-response. RESULTS: Interview non-completion occurred for 42.3% of interview-sampled individuals; urine non-completion occurred for 43.5% of urine-sampled individuals. Interview-sampled individuals, interview respondents, those selected for urine samples and those providing urine samples were each in turn slightly more at-risk for most STIs, leading to lower prevalence estimates after incorporating each set of weights. Researcher-controlled sampling had more impact than respondent-controlled response.

A gender and sexuality inclusive campaign, PrEP4Love is intended to be culturally responsive and sex positive, while retaining a focus on risk reduction. Advertisements prominently feature Black sexual minority men, and Black transgender women, and were strategically placed in diverse Chicago neighbourhoods. In response, there were 212 new callers to the PrEPLine during the two-month study period. Negative responses were concerned with: negatively depicting Black homosexuality (4), general anti-LGBTQ comments (7), adverse effects on children (6), sexually explicit nature (5), and general stigmatisation of racial minorities (4). Discussion focuses on sex-positive frameworks, normalising intimacy, stigma and historical mistrust of medical and pharmaceutical institutions, and the social meanings of biomedical prevention technologies (e.g. PrEP) in relation to dominant norms of sexuality and gender. This study is the first to investigate public responses to a sex-positive PrEP campaign. More studies of PrEP social marketing are needed to evaluate targeted public health campaigns to guide future PrEP promotion strategies.\")\n",

Protecting the brain is, therefore, critical as efforts proceed to cure HIV infection by reactivating latent viral reservoirs and driving immune responses. We review the clinical presentation and pathology findings of inflammatory processes in the CNS in patients managed with ART and the drivers of these processes. RECENT FINDINGS: Chronic inflammation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and HIV infection increases the risk for chronic diseases, especially cognitive impairment. Latent viral reservoirs, including microglia and tissue macrophages, contribute to inflammation in the CNS. Inflammation is generated and maintained through residual viral replication, dysregulation of infected cells, continuously produced viral proteins and positive feedback loops of chronic inflammation. Novel therapeutics and lifestyle changes may help to protect the CNS from immune-mediated damage. SUMMARY: As therapies are developed to cure HIV, it is important to protect the CNS from additional immune-mediated damage. Adjunctive therapies to restore glial function, reduce neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation, and inhibit expression of viral proteins are needed.')\n",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the use of SMS to capture clinical outcomes that occur at home and identify potential biases in reporting compared to in-person ascertainment. METHODS: In the PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents program, which integrated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) into antenatal care, postnatal care, and family planning facilities in Kisumu County, Kenya, HIV-negative women 14 years of age or older were offered oral HIV self-tests (HIVSTs) to take home to male partners. Women that brought a phone with a Safaricom SIM to the clinic were offered registration in an automated SMS system (mSurvey) to collect information on HIVST outcomes. Women were asked if they offered the test to their male partners, and asked about the test process and results. HIVST outcomes were collected via SMS (sent 2.5 weeks later), in-person (if women returned for a follow-up scheduled 1 month later), or using both methods (if women initiated PrEP, they also had scheduled follow-up visits). The SMS prompted women to reply at no charge. HIVST outcomes were compared between women with scheduled follow-up visits and those without (follow-up visits were only scheduled for women who initiated PrEP). HIVST outcomes were also compared between women reporting via SMS and in-person. RESULTS: Among 2123 women offered HIVSTs and mSurvey registration, 486 (23.89%) accepted HIVSTs, of whom 359 (73.87%) were eligible for mSurvey. Additionally, 76/170 (44.7%) women with scheduled follow-up visits and 146/189 (77.3%) without scheduled follow-up visits registered in mSurvey. Among the 76 women with scheduled follow-ups, 62 (82%) had HIVST outcomes collected: 19 (31%) in-person, 20 (32%) by SMS, and 23 (37%) using both methods. Among the 146 women without scheduled visits, 87 (59.6%) had HIVST outcomes collected: 3 (3%) in-person, 82 (94%) by SMS, and 2 (2%) using both methods. SMS increased the collection of HIVST outcomes substantially for women with scheduled follow-up visits (1.48-fold), and captured 82 additional reports from women without scheduled follow-up visits. Among 222 women with reported HIVST outcomes, frequencies of offering partners the HIVST (85/95, 89% in-person vs 96/102, 94% SMS; P=.31), partners using the HIVST (83/85, 98% vs 92/96, 96%; P=.50), women using HIVST with partners (82/83, 99% vs 91/92, 99%; P=.94), and seeing partner's HIVST results (82/83, 99% vs 89/92, 97%; P=.56) were similar between women reporting in-person only versus by SMS only. However, frequency of reports of experiencing harm or negative reactions from partners was more commonly reported in the SMS group (17/102, 16.7% vs 2/85, 2%; P=.003). Barriers to the SMS system registration included not having a Safaricom SIM or a functioning phone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the use of SMS substantially improves completeness of outcome data, does not bias reporting of nonsensitive information, and may increase reporting of sensitive information. .\")\n",

The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection and associated risk factors among PWID in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, following the introduction of a comprehensive HIV intervention package (CHIP) for PWID in the country in 2014. METHODS: We conducted an integrated bio-behavioral survey (IBBS) among PWID using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between October and December 2017. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and risky behaviors were collected through face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected and tested for HIV infection. We accounted for weighting in the analyses, and logistic regression was performed to assess risk factors for HIV infection. RESULTS: A total of 611 PWID (94.4% males and 5.6% females) with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-38) were recruited. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 8.7% (95% CI 6.5-10.9). The prevalence of HIV infections for males and females were 6.8% (95% CI 4.7-8.9%) and 41.2% (95% CI 23.7-58.6%) respectively. Adjusted weighted logistic regression analysis (WLRA) showed that being a female (aOR 19.1; 95% CI 5.9-61.8), injecting drugs for more than 10 years (aOR = 7.32; 95% CI 2.1-25.5) compared to 1 year or less and being 45 years or older (aOR = 34.22; 95% CI 2.4-489.5) compared to being 25 years or younger were associated with increased odds of HIV infection. Use of a sterile needle at last injection decreased odds of HIV infection (aOR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The present study observed a decline in prevalence of HIV infections among PWID in Dar es Salaam (8.7%) compared to a previous estimate of 15.5% from an IBBS conducted in 2013. Despite the decrease, HIV prevalence remains high among PWID compared to the general population, and women are disproportionally affected. The decline may be possibly attributed to the on-going implementation of CHIP for PWID, highlighting the need for strengthening the existing harm reduction interventions by incorporating access to sterile needle/syringe and addressing the layered risks for women.')\n",

This systematic review assessed trends of lifetime self-reported PrEP use and disparities among key populations. METHODS: We used the CDC HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis cumulative database of electronic and manual searches in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from 2000 to 2019 to identify English-language primary studies reporting PrEP use. Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated pooled proportions and crude/adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: We identified 95 eligible studies including 95,854 US-based survey respondents. A few studies (6.3%) focused on persons who inject drugs. In 2015-2017, men who have sex with men (MSM) had highest proportion of individuals who used PrEP over their lifetime [13.9% (95% confidence interval: 8.8 to 21.1), k (number of surveys) = 49] followed by Hispanic/Latinos [11.5 (7.1 to 18.1), 12], transgender women [11.2 (5.8 to 20.6), 5], and blacks [9.9 (8.3 to 11.8), 18]. Odds of PrEP use increased by 34%/year [odds ratio = 1.34/year (95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.64)] and significantly increased over time among MSM [1.53/year (1.21-1.93)] and blacks [1.44 (1.13-1.83)].

Odds of reporting lifetime PrEP use was twice [2.07 (1.27-3.38)] as great among MSM than non-MSM. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of PrEP use in published surveys have been growing, but remain low for people in the Southern United States and youth, and understudied in persons who inject drugs.

We investigated women's preferences across 10 PrEP modalities currently available or under study and examined associations between PrEP modality preferences and contraception practices. Heterosexually active women recently engaged in care at Connecticut Planned Parenthood centers (n = 563) completed an online survey. Participants were presented with images and descriptions of 10 PrEP modalities and asked to indicate their preference and specify their reasoning in an open-response format. Participants also reported prior and current use of 16 contraception modalities along with relationship, sexual health, and sociodemographic characteristics. The sample included women ages 18-45 (45.3% 25 or younger) who were predominantly non-Hispanic black (35.7%) or white (33.7%). All PrEP modalities presented were preferred by at least some women, with daily pills (24.9%), injections (24.3%), and invisible implants (14.9%) preferred most commonly. Across all modalities, associated reasoning often centered around ease of use and comfort. Coincidence with contraception modality was the third-most common reason underlying women's preferences. Women currently using the analogous contraception modality versus never having used it had higher odds of preferring PrEP daily pills [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.03], injections (AOR = 8.45), invisible implants (AOR = 11.63), and vaginal rings (AOR = 8.66). Diversification of available PrEP modalities and prioritization of those coinciding with popular contraception practices-especially daily pills, injections, and implants-could optimize PrEP acceptability, encourage PrEP uptake, and ultimately reduce HIV incidence among women.\")\n",

METHODS: Using targeted sampling methods, 814 PWID who reported regular opioid use (at least 12 uses in the last 30 days) were recruited and interviewed about demographics, drug use, health risk, and withdrawal symptoms, frequency, and pain. Multivariable regression models were developed to examine factors associated with any opioid withdrawal, withdrawal frequency, pain severity, and two important health risks (receptive syringe sharing and non-fatal overdose). RESULTS: Opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported by 85 % of participants in the last 6 months, with 29 % reporting at least monthly withdrawal symptoms and 35 % reporting at least weekly withdrawal symptoms.

STUDY DESIGN: Patients initiating PrEP were followed quarterly until they withdrew from PrEP care or the study ended. Self-reported OOP medication and clinic visit costs were assessed by semiannual questionnaires. Persistence was defined as the time from study enrollment to the last visit after which two subsequent 3-month visits were missed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the effect of demographics, insurance, and OOP costs on PrEP persistence. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 918 participants with OOP cost data, the average quarterly OOP cost was $34 (median: $5, IQR: $0-$25). Participants who were men, White, employed, completed college, and had commercial insurance had higher OOP costs. Higher OOP costs were not associated with lower PrEP persistence by Cox proportional hazards regression (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.00 per $50 increase, 95% CI = 0.97, 1.02).

METHODS: Two 3-day, online, asynchronous focus groups were conducted with transgender youth from across the United States to better understand participant HIV risk and experiences with HIV preventive services. Participants were recruited by using online advertisements posted via youth organizations. Qualitative data were analyzed by using content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 transgender youth participated. The average age was 18.6 years, and youth reported a wide range of gender identities (eg, 27% were transgender male, 17% were transgender female, and 27% used >/=1 term) and sexual orientations.

We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. FINDINGS: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96.2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per muL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2.48, 95% CI 2.05-3.08) but not after 30 days (1.25, 0.84-2.49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3.15, 95% CI 1.16-8.84). INTERPRETATION: In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients. FUNDING: This study was supported by Wellcome fellowships 109105Z/15/A and 105165/Z/14/A.')\n",

We investigated the association between measures of women's empowerment and health facility-based delivery in Northeastern and Western Kenya. METHODS: Analysis of 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey data was conducted. Logistic regression adjusting for demographic factors, contraceptive use, and comprehensive HIV knowledge was used to assess the influence of the validated African Women's Empowerment Index-East (AWEI-E) on the likelihood of women's most recent birth having occurred in a health facility versus at home. Additionally, we explored the mediating effect of contraceptive use on women's empowerment and health facility-based delivery. RESULTS: Compared to respondents with low or moderate empowerment scores, those with high empowerment scores were more likely to have given birth at a health facility [odds ratio (OR) = 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30, 2.51], although this effect was null in the adjusted model (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.58, 1.45).

Current contraceptive use mediated 26.8% of the effect of empowerment on the odds of facility-based delivery. CONCLUSION: Women's empowerment, and its comprising three domains as measured by the AWEI-E, may be insufficient to overcome barriers to facility-based delivery for women in North Eastern or Western Kenya. High women's empowerment is strongly associated with current contraceptive use, which may inform pregnancy planning and location of delivery. Alternatively, higher empowered women who delivered at a facility may have been offered contraceptives at the time of delivery. Future research targeting these regions should explore culturally acceptable approaches to broadening access to skilled supervision of labor.\")\n",

METHODS: We used data from a nationally representative, cross-sectional online survey of AYA aged 13-26 years (n = 1,509) who had had a visit in the past 2 years. Bivariate analyses examined 11 topics. Multivariable regression identified health care factors and demographic factors related to unmet need across four salient topics (HIV/sexually transmitted infections, alcohol and drug use, tobacco, and contraception). RESULTS: Across 11 topics, unmet need averaged 28% and ranged as high as 60%; unmet need generally increased with AYA age. In multivariable analyses, ever having discussed confidentiality with a health care provider was associated with greater desire to discuss three of four salient topics, increased discussions (four of four topics), and reduced unmet need (two topics). Patient use of a clinical checklist/questionnaire at the last medical visit was associated with an increase in discussions (four topics) and reduced unmet need (four topics). Longer office visits were associated with an increase in discussions (three topics) and reduced unmet need (two topics). Older and minority youth had greater desire for discussions and unmet need.

Here, we present longer term data for this patient (up to 30 months after ATI), including sampling from diverse HIV-1 reservoir sites. METHODS: We used ultrasensitive viral load assays of plasma, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to detect HIV-1 RNA. In gut biopsy samples and lymph-node tissue, cell-copy number and total HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified in multiple replicates, using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. We also analysed the presence of intact proviral DNA using multiplex ddPCR targeting the packaging signal (psi) and envelope (env). We did intracellular cytokine staining to measure HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. We used low-sensitive and low-avidity antibody assays to measure the humoral response to HIV-1. We predicted the probability of rebound using a mathematical model and inference approach. FINDINGS: HIV-1 viral load in plasma remained undetectable in the London patient up to 30 months (last tested on March 4, 2020), using an assay with a detection limit of 1 copy per mL. The patient's CD4 count was 430 cells per muL (23.5% of total T cells) at 28 months. A very low-level positive signal for HIV-1 DNA was recorded in peripheral CD4 memory cells at 28 months. The viral load in semen was undetectable in both plasma (lower limit of detection [LLD] <12 copies per mL) and cells (LLD 10 copies per 10(6) cells) at 21 months. CSF was within normal parameters at 25 months, with HIV-1 RNA below the detection limit (LLD 1 copy per mL). HIV-1 DNA by ddPCR was negative in rectum, caecum, and sigmoid colon and terminal ileum tissue samples at 22 months. Lymph-node tissue from axilla was positive for the long-terminal repeat (33 copies per 10(6) cells) and env (26.1 copies per 10(6) cells), negative for psi and integrase, and negative by the intact proviral DNA assay, at 27 months. HIV-1-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses have remained absent at 27 months. Low-avidity Env antibodies have continued to decline. Mathematical modelling suggests that the probability of remission for life (cure) is 98% in the context of 80% donor chimerism in total HIV target cells and greater than 99% probability of remission for life with 90% donor chimerism. INTERPRETATION: The London patient has been in HIV-1 remission for 30 months with no detectable replication-competent virus in blood, CSF, intestinal tissue, or lymphoid tissue. Donor chimerism has been maintained at 99% in peripheral T cells. We propose that these findings represent HIV-1 cure.

METHODS: Adult (>/=15 years) patients with baseline CD4 counts < 500 cells/mul that initiated treatment at one of two HIV treatment centers in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire between 1998 and 2004 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were stratified by baseline CD4 counts and survival analyses were employed to examine the relationship between HIV type and time to achieving CD4 >/= 500 cells/mul during follow up.

Despite the unavailability of clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for antifungal agents, epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) were recently proposed, and non-wild-type isolates for polyenes and azoles are being increasingly reported. However, the distributions of the susceptibility patterns for pre-HIV-era isolates have not been studied. Methods: We determined the in vitro antifungal susceptibility patterns of 233 Cryptococcus isolates, collected at the National Institutes of Health, USA, in pre-HIV pandemic era, to study minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to the important drugs for cryptococcosis and to compare the results with strain genotypes. Amphotericin B susceptibility was compared to published ECV of C. neoformans. Results: The 233 Cryptococcus strains consisted of 89.7% C. neoformans species complex and 10.3% C. gattii species complex. Most were from clinical sources (189, 81.1%), and the major molecular type was VNI (146, 62.7%). The highest geometric mean (GM) was observed for fluconazole (GM = 0.96 microg/mL) while the lowest was for itraconazole (GM = 0.10 microg/mL). MICs to fluconazole in C. gattii species complex were significantly higher than C. neoformans species complex (p < 0.001). Moreover, C. neoformans/VNI strains showed significantly higher MICs than others such as C. neoformans/VNII to fluconazole (p < 0.0001) and C. deneoformans/VNIV to amphotericin B (p = 0.022) and fluconazole (p = 0.008). In our collection of 167 clinical C. neoformans species complex strains, 85 (50.9%), 24 (14.4%), and 3 (1.8%) strains had an amphotericin B (AMB)-MIC of 1, 2, and 4 microg/mL, respectively. The high percentage (66.9%, 79/118 strains) of non-wild-type clinical C. neoformans VNI strains, using an AMB-ECV of 0.5 microg/mL, was found. Moreover, 25 of 28 (89.3%) C. neoformans VNI strains from environmental and veterinary sources also had AMB-MICs above 0.5 microg/mL. In general, there was no significant difference in GM AMB-MIC of the clinical strains isolated from patients with (35 patients) and without (78 patients) prior AMB treatment (0.85 vs 0.76; p = 0.624). GM MIC of the environmental strains was not significantly different from that of the prior AMB-treatment strains (0.98 vs 0.76, p = 0.159) and the post-AMB-treatment strains (0.98 vs 0.85, p = 0.488). Conclusion: The high rate of non-wild-type among these otherwise naive isolates to amphotericin B is unexpected. Confirmation with more strains from a later era is needed.')\n",

CD4 binding changes Env from a pretriggered (state-1) conformation to more open downstream conformations. BMS-378806 (here called BMS-806) blocks CD4-induced conformational changes in Env important for entry and is hypothesized to stabilize a state-1-like Env conformation, a key vaccine target. Here, we evaluated the effects of BMS-806 on the conformation of Env on the surface of cells and virus-like particles. BMS-806 strengthened the labile, noncovalent interaction of gp120 with the Env trimer, enhanced or maintained the binding of most broadly neutralizing antibodies, and decreased the binding of poorly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, in the presence of BMS-806, the cleaved Env on the surface of cells and virus-like particles exhibits an antigenic profile consistent with a state-1 conformation. We designed novel BMS-806 analogues that stabilized the Env conformation for several weeks after a single application. These long-acting BMS-806 analogues may facilitate enrichment of the metastable state-1 Env conformation for structural characterization and presentation to the immune system.IMPORTANCE The envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mediates the entry of the virus into host cells and is also the target for antibodies. During virus entry, Env needs to change shape. Env flexibility also contributes to the ability of HIV-1 to evade the host immune response; many shapes of Env raise antibodies that cannot recognize the functional Env and therefore do not block virus infection. We found that an HIV-1 entry inhibitor, BMS-806, stabilizes the functional shape of Env. We developed new variants of BMS-806 that stabilize Env in its natural state for long periods of time. The availability of such long-acting stabilizers of Env shape will allow the natural Env conformation to be characterized and tested for efficacy as a vaccine.')\n",

To better understand the mechanism for preterm birth among HIV-infected women, we evaluated whether mid-trimester cervical length differed by HIV status as cervical shortening is associated with an increased risk for preterm birth. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among pregnant women receiving care at the Scottish Livingstone Hospital in Molepolole, Botswana. Consecutive women referred for routine obstetrical ultrasound were consented and enrolled if between 22w0d and 24w6d by ultrasound biometry. Blinded to maternal HIV status, an obstetrician measured transvaginal cervical length using standardized criteria. Cervical length, as well as the proportion of women with a short cervix (<25mm), were compared among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The acceptability of transvaginal ultrasound was also evaluated. RESULTS: Between April 2016 and April 2017, 853 women presenting for obstetric ultrasound were screened, 187 (22%) met eligibility criteria, and 179 (96%) were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 50 (28%) were HIV-infected (86% on antiretroviral therapy), 127 (71%) were HIV-uninfected, and 2 (1%) had unknown HIV status.

Although integrated retroviral DNA, known as a provirus, can be found at many sites in the host genome, integration is not random. The adaption of linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) protocols for high-throughput integration site mapping, using randomly-sheared genomic DNA and Illumina paired-end sequencing, has dramatically increased the number of mapped integration sites. Analysis of samples from human donors has shown that there is clonal expansion of HIV infected cells and that clonal expansion makes an important contribution to HIV persistence. However, analysis of HIV integration sites in samples taken from patients requires extensive PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing, which makes the methodology prone to certain specific artifacts. RESULTS: To address the problems with artifacts, we use a comprehensive approach involving experimental procedures linked to a bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Using this combined approach, we are able to reduce the number of PCR/sequencing artifacts that arise and identify the ones that remain. Our streamlined workflow combines random cleavage of the DNA in the samples, end repair, and linker ligation in a single step. We provide guidance on primer and linker design that reduces some of the common artifacts. We also discuss how to identify and remove some of the common artifacts, including the products of PCR mispriming and PCR recombination, that have appeared in some published studies. Our improved bioinformatics pipeline rapidly parses the sequencing data and identifies bona fide integration sites in clonally expanded cells, producing an Excel-formatted report that can be used for additional data processing.

Methods: Study participants consisted of 120 crack cocaine-using participants in a larger community-based HIV/STD prevention and research program targeting at-risk African-Americans. They were required to return for a series of four booster health education sessions over 2-5 days and 6 month and 1 year follow-up assessments. The most difficult aspect of this program was no-shows for the second booster session; study participants who attended at least two sessions were much more likely to attend all sessions and complete the entire lengthy program. The program director randomly approached some participants after the first visit in a public setting and briefly touched them as part of a handshake; then, the director asked them to return for their follow-up sessions.

METHODS: In 2015, three large urban school districts (2 in California and 1 in Florida) conducted a Youth Risk Behavior Survey that included the assessment of gender expression among a racially/ethnically diverse population-based sample of 6,082 high school students. Five categories of violence victimization were assessed (felt unsafe at school, threatened or injured with a weapon at school, bullied at school, electronically bullied, and forced sexual intercourse). In 2019, the effect of violence victimization on substance use disparities was examined by calculating sex-stratified prevalence ratios by gender nonconformity, adjusted for sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and grade (adjusted prevalence ratio 1 [APR1]), and comparing these with prevalence ratios adjusted for those variables plus violence victimization (adjusted prevalence ratio 2 [APR2]). RESULTS: Among female students, only being threatened or injured with a weapon was significantly (p<0.05) associated with gender nonconformity and there were no substance use disparities by gender nonconformity.

METHODS: Echocardiography was performed on PHIV+ and age- and sex-frequency-matched HIV- adolescents enrolled in the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort. Participants were eligible if they were 9 to 14 years of age and had been on ART for >/=6 months. RESULTS: Overall, 474 PHIV+ adolescents (median age, 12 years; 51% boys; mean age at ART initiation, 5 years) and 109 HIV- adolescents (median age, 11.8 years; 45% boys) were included.

Compared with HIV- adolescents, PHIV+ adolescents had higher median Z scores for left ventricular (LV) internal end-diastolic dimension, LV end-systolic posterior wall thickness, and end-systolic interventricular septal thickness. PHIV+ adolescents had a lower median Z score for right ventricular internal end-diastolic dimension as compared with HIV- adolescents.

METHODS: We adapted an existing SMS platform (Mobile WACh [mWACh]) to send PrEP-tailored, theory-based SMS and allow clients to communicate with a remote nurse. Women who did not have HIV and who were initiating PrEP at 2 MCH/family planning clinics in Kisumu County, Kenya, from February to October 2018, were offered enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; SMS communication was free. We evaluated acceptability, satisfaction, and implementation metrics. In a pre/postevaluation, we compared PrEP continuation at 1-month postinitiation among women who initiated PrEP in the period before (n=166) versus after mWACh-PrEP implementation, adjusting for baseline differences. RESULTS: Of the 334 women who were screened for enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; 193 (58%) were eligible and of those, 190 (98%) accepted enrollment. Reasons for ineligibility (n=141) included no phone access (29%) and shared SIM cards (25%). Median age was 25 years (interquartile range=22-30), and 91% were MCH clients. Compared to women who initiated PrEP in the month before mWACh-PrEP implementation, women who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP were more likely to return for their first PrEP follow-up visit (40% vs. 53%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR]=1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.06, 1.50; P=.008) and more likely to continue PrEP (22% vs. 43%; aRR=1.75; 95% CI=1.21, 2.55; P=.003). Among those who returned, 99% reported successful receipt of SMS through the mWACh-PrEP system and 94% reported that mWACh-PrEP helped them understand PrEP better. Concerns about PrEP use, how it works, and side effects accounted for the majority (80%) of issues raised by participants using SMS.

Malaria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in school-age children. However, they are less likely to receive malaria treatment at health facilities and evidence for how to improve schoolchildren's access to care is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a programme of school-based malaria case management on schoolchildren's attendance, health and education. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 58 primary schools in Zomba District, Malawi, 2011-2015. The intervention, implemented in 29 randomly selected schools, provided malaria rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination therapy to diagnose and treat uncomplicated malaria as part of basic first aid kits known as 'Learner Treatment Kits' (LTK). The primary outcome was school attendance, assessed through teacher-recorded daily attendance registers and independent periodic attendance spot checks. Secondary outcomes included prevalence of Plasmodium spp infection, anaemia, educational performance, self-reported child well-being and health-seeking behaviour. A total of 9571 children from standards 1-7 were randomly selected for assessment of school attendance, with subsamples assessed for the secondary outcomes. Results: Between November 2013 and March 2015, 97 trained teachers in 29 schools provided 32 685 unique consultations. Female schoolchildren were significantly more likely than male to seek a consultation (unadjusted OR=1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 2.00).

However, the poor physicochemical properties of fulvestrant require monthly intramuscular injections to patients, which limit the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of the compound. Therefore, an orally available compound that more rapidly reaches steady state may lead to a better clinical response in patients. Here, we report the identification of G1T48, a novel orally bioavailable, non-steroidal small molecule antagonist of ER. METHODS: The pharmacological effects and the antineoplastic mechanism of action of G1T48 on tumors was evaluated using human breast cancer cells (in vitro) and xenograft efficacy models (in vivo). RESULTS: G1T48 is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of estrogen-mediated transcription and proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cells, similar to the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant. In addition, G1T48 can effectively suppress ER activity in multiple models of endocrine therapy resistance including those harboring ER mutations and growth factor activation. In vivo, G1T48 has robust antitumor activity in a model of estrogen-dependent breast cancer (MCF7) and significantly inhibited the growth of tamoxifen-resistant (TamR), long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) and patient-derived xenograft tumors with an increased response being observed with the combination of G1T48 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor lerociclib.

Significant covariates of PrEP interest were being single, more prior PrEP knowledge, sexual risk behaviors, such as not having used a condom during last sex and having ever used drugs in a sexual context, and not participating in the AmsterdamPinkPanel. Adding the recruitment strategy to the regression increased explained variance on top of predictors already described in the literature. Increased sexual risk behavior is related to increased PrEP interest and it helps to identify PrEP target groups.

Because population statistics are not available for the region, estimates are derived from smaller cohort studies. Microbiota associated with cervical inflammation have been found to be especially prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and to associate with increased cervical cancer risk. In addition to high prevalence and diversity of HIV and HPV, intracellular bacterial infections such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Mycoplasma hominis are much more common than in regions with a low burden of cervical cancer.

It represents a group of pathophysiologic processes that have a common end point, that is, bowel infarction, and has a nonspecific clinical picture and a high mortality rate. The most common underlying etiologies are arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and mesenteric venous thrombosis. NOMI is caused by prolonged functional vasoconstriction of the visceral arterial vessels, leading to progressive intestinal ischemia, and could be defined by the absence of atherosclerotic thrombotic or embolic occlusion of the mesenteric arteries. The pathophysiology of NOMI remains poorly understood. It can occur in a wide range of critical systemic illnesses associated with hypotension and hypovolemia and in patients on hemodialysis. Elevation of serum lactate may not be present in a significant portion of patients with AMI, which creates an additional obstacle to the prompt diagnosis and often delays treatment.

Results: Twenty-two of 2063 HIV-infected individuals had a cumulative length of stay >30 days in the study period. These individuals accrued 99 emergency department attendances and 1581 inpatient bed days, with a direct cost to the hospital of >euro1 million during the study period. Eighteen of 22 had potentially preventable requirements for unscheduled care. Two of 18 had a late diagnosis of HIV. Sixteen of 18 had not been successfully engaged in outpatient HIV care and presented with consequences of advanced HIV. Fourteen of 16 of those who were not successfully engaged in care had >/=1 barrier to care (addiction, psychiatric disease, and/or homelessness). Conclusions: A small number of HIV-infected individuals account for a high volume of acute unscheduled care. Intensive engagement in outpatient care may prevent some of this usage and ensuing costs.\")\n",

A systematic review was conducted in February 2019 using PubMed to identify barriers to PrEP prescribing practices in the United States. Targeted search terms surrounding PrEP and providers resulted in 222 original studies, 28 of which were ultimately included in our review, with data collected between 2011 and 2018. Six themes were identified across reviewed studies: (i) a lack of PrEP knowledge, (ii) the presence of the Purview Paradox, which refers to discordance in beliefs between HIV specialists and primary care providers on who should prescribe PrEP, (iii) concerns about PrEP costs, (iv) concerns about behavioral and health consequences, (v) interpersonal stigma, and (vi) concerns about patient adherence. A majority of providers were lacking knowledge regarding PrEP, resulting in discomfort in prescribing PrEP, or limited awareness and understanding of PrEP clinical guidelines. Discrepant opinions were identified regarding whether PrEP was best managed within primary care or specialty clinics. Other barriers included concerns about cost, patient adherence, and follow-up maintenance care. Finally, concerns about risk compensation and discomfort discussing sexual activities with patients who would benefit most from PrEP were apparent. Additional work is needed to prepare providers to prescribe and manage patients on PrEP, optimize PrEP delivery, and reduce provider bias. Future research is needed to identify providers' attitudes and beliefs regarding innovations in PrEP dosing, task shifting, and novel strategies for PrEP care.\")\n",

We interviewed 458 women accessing HIV-care at the three tertiary hospitals in Ogun State, Nigeria. Trained research assistants conducted 10-min structured interviews with validated questionnaires. We carried out descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses. We used the backward elimination technique to build a model to predict the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) within the preceding 12 months. We set the level of significance at .05. A total of 23 (5.02%) participants reported IPV within the preceding 12 months, while the prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence was 24.02%. Younger age, the experience of IPV in previous relationships, and having multiple sex partners were related to the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months (p < .05). Also, the partners' age, alcohol intake, and current smoking status were associated with the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months (p < .05). After regression analysis, participants' age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.892, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.831, 0.957]), experience of IPV in previous relationship (AOR = 12.841, 95% CI = [4.303, 38.318]), and partners' current smoking status (AOR = 4.874, 95% CI = [1.252, 18.969]) retained association with the experience of IPV within the preceding 12 months.

Initial steps of transmission, including cell attachment and entry, likely occur in the presence of semen. However, the unstable nature of human seminal plasma and its toxic effects on cells in culture limit the ability to study in vitro virus infection and inhibition in this medium. We found that whole semen significantly reduces the potency of antibodies and microbicides that target glycans on the envelope glycoproteins (Envs) of HIV-1. The extraordinarily high concentration of the monosaccharide fructose in semen contributes significantly to the effect by competitively inhibiting the binding of ligands to alpha1,2-linked mannose residues on Env. Infection and inhibition in whole human seminal plasma are accurately mimicked by a stable synthetic simulant of seminal fluid that we formulated. Our findings indicate that, in addition to the protein content of biological secretions, their small-solute composition impacts the potency of antiviral microbicides and mucosal antibodies.IMPORTANCE Biological secretions allow viruses to spread between individuals. Each type of secretion has a unique composition of proteins, salts, and sugars, which can affect the infectivity potential of the virus and inhibition of this process. Here, we describe HIV-1 infection and inhibition in whole human seminal plasma and a synthetic simulant that we formulated. We discovered that the sugar fructose in semen decreases the activity of a broad and potent class of antiviral agents that target mannose sugars on the envelope protein of HIV-1. This effect of semen fructose likely reduces the efficacy of such inhibitors to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1. Our findings suggest that the preclinical evaluation of microbicides and vaccine-elicited antibodies will be improved by their in vitro assessment in synthetic formulations that simulate the effects of semen on HIV-1 infection and inhibition.')\n",

An alternative hypothesis is that vaginal bacteria present around conception may lead to SPTB by compromising the protective effects of cervical mucus, colonising the endometrial surface before fetal membrane development, and causing low-level inflammation in the decidua, placenta and fetal membranes. This protocol describes a prospective case-cohort study addressing this hypothesis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: HIV-seronegative Kenyan women with fertility intent are followed from preconception through pregnancy, delivery and early postpartum. Participants provide monthly vaginal specimens during the preconception period for vaginal microbiota assessment. Estimated date of delivery is determined by last menstrual period and first trimester obstetrical ultrasound. After delivery, a swab is collected from between the fetal membranes. Placenta and umbilical cord samples are collected for histopathology. Broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR and deep sequencing of preconception vaginal specimens will assess species richness and diversity in women with SPTB versus term delivery. Concentrations of key bacterial species will be compared using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Taxon-directed qPCR will also be used to quantify bacteria from fetal membrane samples and evaluate the association between bacterial concentrations and histopathological evidence of inflammation in the fetal membranes, placenta and umbilical cord. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by ethics committees at Kenyatta National Hospital and the University of Washington. Results will be disseminated to clinicians at study sites and partner institutions, presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

In this paper, binding free energies between two HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) proteases and four inhibitors are calculated by molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) combined with the newly developed interaction entropy (IE) approach. The internal dielectric constant is set on the basis of different types of amino acids. The entropy change in protein-ligand binding is computed by IE method which is superior to the traditional normal mode (Nmode) method in the analysis of the ranking of binding free energy, statistical stability and enthalpy-entropy compensation. Importantly, IE method combined with alanine scanning is applied to calculate residue-specific binding free energy. And the calculated total binding free energy using the current method is in excellent with the experimental observed. Our research indicates that HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases share the common hot-spot residues with ILE50/50' and ILE84/ILE84' which provide the major favorable contribution to the binding of protein and inhibitor in all systems. The predicted hot-spot residues are more in HIV-1 complex than HIV-2 complex and some hot-spot residues contributing to HIV-1 don't play a significant role in HIV-2. To some extent, this explains the reason of decrease in potency inhibitors against HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 protease.

METHODS: This was an observational longitudinal study using data from the Women's Adherence and Visit Engagement substudy of the Women's Interagency HIV Study. WWH (N = 375) completed measures of depressive symptoms, adherence self-efficacy, and ART adherence. Viral load was measured through blood draw. We examined a longitudinal sequential path model spanning 3 time points at least 6 months apart between 2015 and 2017.

METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial was undertaken at six clinical sites in the UK. Patients aged 18-60 years who were confirmed as HIV-positive within a maximum of the past 6 months and started ART within 1 month from confirmed diagnosis were randomly assigned by a computer generated randomisation list to receive ART-only (control) or ART plus the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (the kick) and replication-deficient viral vector T-cell inducing vaccines encoding conserved HIV sequences ChAdV63.

The primary endpoint was total HIV DNA isolated from peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells at weeks 16 and 18 after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02336074. FINDINGS: Between June 14, 2015 and Jul 11, 2017, 60 men with HIV were randomly assigned to receive either an ART-only (n=30) or an ART + V + V (n=30) regimen; all 60 participants completed the study, with no loss-to-follow-up. Mean total HIV DNA at weeks 16 and 18 after randomisation was 3.02 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in the ART-only group versus 3.06 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells in ART + V + V group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (mean difference of 0.04 log10 copies HIV DNA per 10(6) CD4(+) T-cells [95% CI -0.03 to 0.11; p=0.26]).

Methods: The cluster randomized trial included 376 adults in 32 communes in eight provinces. Eligible participants scored > 7 on the SRQ-20 depression scale. Patients with severe symptoms were excluded and referred to tertiary care. Randomization took place at the commune level. The immediate intervention group included 16 communes with 190 participants and the delayed group included 16 communes with 186 participants. Participants in communes randomized to the immediate intervention group received a two-month course of SSM, consisting of a workbook and supportive coaching. Those in communes randomized to the delayed group received enhanced treatment as usual and, for ethical purposes, received the SSM intervention after 4 months. The primary outcome is the effect of SSM on reduction in depression scores as indicated by a reduced proportion of participants with SRQ-20 scores > 7 at 2 months after commencement of SSM intervention. Blinding was not possible during intervention delivery but outcome assessors were blinded. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Results: At 2 months, 26.4% of the intervention group and 42.3% of the delayed group had SRQ-20 scores > 7.

In this study, we designed a panel of novel immunogens that 1) preferentially expose the CD4bs by selective elimination of glycosylation sites flanking the CD4bs, and 2) minimize the nND immune response by engineering fusion proteins consisting of gp120 Core and one or two CD4-induced (CD4i) mAbs for masking nND epitopes, referred to as gp120-CD4i fusion proteins.

Furthermore, we examined whether HIV status and the interaction between HIV and alcohol consumption was associated with differences in these brain networks. METHODS: Fifty adults, 26 of whom were HIV positive, engaged in an n-back working memory task (0-back and 2-back trials) administered in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

Connectivity analyses were conducted using data collected during n-back task. RESULTS: Functional connectivity differences associated with greater alcohol consumption included negative connectivity, primarily from parietal attention networks to frontal networks. Greater alcohol consumption was also associated with positive connectivity from working memory nodes to the precuneus and paracingulate. HIV positive status was associated with more nodes of negative functional connectivity relative to alcohol consumption history alone, particularly in the frontoparietal networks.

CD4 nadir >/=500 cells/mm(3) was independently associated with a lower rate of ART initiation as compared to CD4 nadir <200 cells/mm(3) (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.37). Age >50 years at diagnosis was independently associated with shorter time to ART initiation as compared to 18 to 29 years (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with changing guidelines, the interval between diagnosis and ART initiation has decreased over time.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-method study at 14 facilities in Kenya, and key informant interviews with health care providers. We abstracted clinical record data, collected specimens, tested specimens for recent infection, returned results to participants, and conducted a follow-up survey for those recently infected. RESULTS: From March to October 2018, we enrolled 532 clients who were diagnosed HIV-positive for the first time. Of these, 46 (8.6%) were recently infected. Women aged 15-24 years had 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.46 to 5.78) times higher adjusted odds of recent infection compared with 15-24-year-old men and those tested within the past 12 months having 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 4.70) times higher adjusted odds compared with those tested >/=12 months previously. Fourteen of 17 providers interviewed found the integration of recency testing into routine HTS services acceptable and feasible.

It is reported that almost 40 to 80% population with MI are not able to resume their sexual routine after the illness due to organic or psychological sexual dysfunction. To reduce the prevalence of sexual dysfunction after MI, cardiac nurses are required to provide sexual counselling to their stable patients. However, this responsibility is seldom fulfilled by nurses due to several barriers. These barriers are not explicitly explored from the nurses' perspective, which is necessary to understand in order to promote sexual counselling in cardiac health care settings. OBJECTIVE: To explore the facilitators and barriers of cardiac nurses in providing sexual education to post-MI patients. DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative systematic review was undertaken by performing a systematic search from six databases along with search from reference lists of related studies. FINDINGS: Four studies revealed 49 findings, which formed 10 categories and yielded four synthesised findings. These are: (1) Institutional Barriers such as lack of education, guidelines and material resources can prevent nurses from providing sexual education to MI patients; (2) Personal barriers such as uncertainty about the nurse's role in sexual education, giving least priority to sexual counselling and lack of comfort with discussing sexuality can affect how nurses provide sexual education to MI patients; (3) Socio-cultural and religious barriers such as contradictory beliefs and gender differences can challenge nurses when providing sexual education to MI patients and (4) Nurses consider different strategies for addressing sexual education with MI patients, in individual or group settings. CONCLUSION: To promote sexual counselling, strategies are proposed by nurses, which can help in limiting barriers and facilitate in conducting counselling sessions. These strategies need to be validated from extensive research before implementing them into nursing practice.\")\n",

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: NHs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 203 NHs and 1375 persons living with HIV. MEASUREMENTS: Medicare claims from 2011 to 2013 were linked to assessments of resident health, prescription dispensing data, and national reports of NH characteristics. Five nationally validated HIV care quality measures (prescription of antiretroviral therapy; CD4/viral load monitoring; frequency of medical visits; gaps in medical visits; and Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis) were adapted and applied to NHs. Logistic regression predicted compliance by organizational factors. Random intercept logistic regression predicted if persons living with HIV received care by person and organizational factors. RESULTS: Compliance ranged from 43.3% (SD = 31.1%) for CD4/viral load monitoring to 92.4% (SD = 13.6%) for gaps in medical visits. More substantiated complaints against an NH decreased the likelihood of high compliance with CD4/viral load monitoring (odds ratio [OR] = 0.846; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.726-0.986), while NH-reported incidents increased the likelihood of high compliance with pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis (OR = 1.173; 95% CI = 1.044-1.317).

METHODS: A qualitative study evaluating health care providers' perceptions of barriers and facilitators of a previously completed financial incentives intervention for pediatric HIV testing was conducted at health care facilities in Kisumu, Kenya. Six focus group discussions with 52 providers explored determinants of acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of financial incentive scale-up for pediatric HIV testing using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to inform question guides and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Providers found the use of financial incentive interventions for pediatric HIV testing to be highly acceptable. First, providers believed financial incentives had a relative advantage over existing strategies, because they overcame cost barriers and provided additional motivation to test; however, concerns about how financial incentives would be implemented influenced perceptions of feasibility and sustainability. Second, providers expressed concern that already overburdened staff and high costs of financial incentive programs would limit sustainability. Third, providers feared that financial incentives may negatively affect further care because of expectations of repeated financial support and program manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: Providers viewed financial incentives as an acceptable intervention to scale programmatically to increase uptake of pediatric testing.

Currently, there is limited information on the circulating HIV-1 strains, the distribution of these strains and antiretroviral (ART) resistant viruses in different regions of the country, and the HIV-1 strains harbored by the high-risk groups like female sex workers (FSW) reported to be the source of recombinant and ART resistant viruses. METHODS: Dried Blood Spots (DBS), collected from 325 infected FSWs in ten cities from 2012 DRC HIV/STI Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey, were tested for HIV-1 genotypes and antiretroviral resistance mutations. Regional segregation of HIV-1 clades was detected using phylogenetics. The significance for differences in HIV-1 subtype and drug resistance mutations were evaluated using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: There were 145 (env) and 93 (pol) sequences analyzed. Based on env sequences, the predominant subtype was A1 (44%), and recombinants as defined pol sequences comprised 35% of the total sample. Paired sequences of pol and env from DRC FSW revealed mosaic recombinant in 54% of the sequences. Distinct geographic distributions of different HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants were observed. Subtype A1 was prevalent (40%) in Goma located in the East and significantly higher than in Mbuji-Mayi (p<0.05) in the South-central region, or in Lubumbashi in the South.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the German Hepatitis C-Registry (DHC-R), which is a national multicenter real-world cohort currently including about 16 500 patients recruited by more than 250 centers. The present analysis is based on 6683 patients who initiated a DAA therapy and for whom follow-up data (per-protocol analysis) were available. RESULTS: Among the patients, 188 (2.8 %) experienced a virologic relapse.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with failure with DAA combination therapies are a difficult but urgent to treat population with the frequent presence of cirrhosis and prior treatment failure with interferon-based therapies.

WHO requested updated modelling results for its 2019 Antiretroviral Guidelines update, which was restricted to the choice of dolutegravir or efavirenz in new ART initiators. In response to this request, we modelled the risks and benefits of alternative policies for initial first-line ART regimens. METHODS: We updated an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults to consider information on the risk of neural tube defects in women taking dolutegravir at time of conception, as well as the effects of dolutegravir on weight gain. The model accounted for drug resistance in determining viral suppression, with consequences for clinical outcomes and mother-to-child transmission. We sampled distributions of parameters to create various epidemic setting scenarios, which reflected the diversity of epidemic and programmatic situations in sub-Saharan Africa. For each setting scenario, we considered the situation in 2018 and compared ART initiation policies of an efavirenz-based regimen in women intending pregnancy, and a dolutegravir-based regimen in others, and a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy. We considered predicted outcomes over a 20-year period from 2019 to 2039, used a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. FINDINGS: Considering updated information on risks and benefits, a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen rather than an efavirenz-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, is predicted to bring population health benefits (10 990 DALYs averted per year) and to be cost-saving (by $2.9 million per year), leading to a reduction in the overall population burden of disease of 16 735 net DALYs per year for a country with an adult population size of 10 million. The policy involving ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen in women intending pregnancy was cost-effective in 87% of our setting scenarios and this finding was robust in various sensitivity analyses, including around the potential negative effects of weight gain. INTERPRETATION: In the context of a range of modelled setting scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, was predicted to bring population health benefits and be cost-effective, supporting WHO's strong recommendation for dolutegravir as a preferred drug for ART initiators.

The aim was to develop and validate a fully-automated Sepsis-3 based surveillance system in non-intensive care wards using electronic health record (EHR) data, and demonstrate utility by determining the burden of hospital-onset sepsis and variations between wards. METHODS: A rule-based algorithm was developed using EHR data from a cohort of all adult patients admitted at an academic centre between July 2012 and December 2013. Time in intensive care units was censored. To validate algorithm performance, a stratified random sample of 1000 hospital admissions (674 with and 326 without suspected infection) was classified according to the Sepsis-3 clinical criteria (suspected infection defined as having any culture taken and at least two doses of antimicrobials administered, and an increase in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score by >2 points) and the likelihood of infection by physician medical record review. RESULTS: In total 82 653 hospital admissions were included. The Sepsis-3 clinical criteria determined by physician review were met in 343 of 1000 episodes. Among them, 313 (91%) had possible, probable or definite infection. Based on this reference, the algorithm achieved sensitivity 0.887 (95% CI: 0.799 to 0.964), specificity 0.985 (95% CI: 0.978 to 0.991), positive predictive value 0.881 (95% CI: 0.833 to 0.926) and negative predictive value 0.986 (95% CI: 0.973 to 0.996). When applied to the total cohort taking into account the sampling proportions of those with and without suspected infection, the algorithm identified 8599 (10.4%) sepsis episodes. The burden of hospital-onset sepsis (>48 hour after admission) and related in-hospital mortality varied between wards.

To date, no validated instrument exists to measure patients' experiences of HCV stigma. This study aimed to revise the Berger (2001) HIV stigma scale and evaluate its psychometric properties among patients with HCV infection. METHODS: The Berger HIV stigma scale was revised to ask about HCV and administered to patients with HCV (n = 270) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Scale reliability was evaluated as internal consistency by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to evaluate construct validity by comparing item clustering to the Berger HIV stigma scale subscales. Item response theory was employed to further evaluate individual items and to calibrate items for simulated computer adaptive testing sessions in order to identify potential shortened instruments. RESULTS: The revised HCV Stigma Scale was found to have good reliability (alpha = 0.957). After excluding items for low loadings, the exploratory factor analysis indicated good construct validity with 85% of items loading on pre-defined factors. Analyses strongly suggested the predominance of an underlying unidimensional factor solution, which yielded a 33-item scale after items were removed for low loading and differential item functioning. Adaptive simulations indicated that the scale could be substantially shortened without detectable information loss. CONCLUSIONS: The 33-item HCV Stigma Scale showed sufficient reliability and construct validity.

To make pills less conspicuous and decrease the risk of being stigmatized, people living with HIV (PLWH) often engage in self-repackaging - the practice of transferring ART from original packaging to alternative containers. This behavior has been associated with ART nonadherence and failure to achieve viral load suppression. While much of the literature on ART packaging has centered around medication adherence, patients stated preferences for ART packaging and packaging attributes that influence the observed ART nonadherence are understudied. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study to elucidate perceptions of ART packaging among PLWH at two large referral hospitals in Northern Tanzania. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded. Results: Of the 16 participants whose data were used in the final analysis, a majority were between 36 and 55 years of age (Mean 45.5 years SD: 11.1), had primary-level education (n=11, 68.8%), were self-employed (n=9, 56.3%), reported that they had self-repacked ART (n=14, 88%), and were taking ART for more than 6 years (n=11, 68.8%). Participants identified three attributes of ART packaging that increased anticipated HIV stigma and prompted self-repackaging, including visual identification, bulkiness, and the rattling noise produced by ART pill bottles. Conclusion: Given the drastic reduction in the number of pills required for HIV treatment, there is an opportunity to not only assess the cost-effectiveness of innovative ART packaging but also evaluate the acceptability of such packaging among PLWH in order to address stigma and improve ART adherence.')\n",

We integrated molecular, epidemiologic, serologic and behavioral data to infer and evaluate transmission linkages between participants of a prospective study of AHI conducted in North Carolina, New York City and San Francisco from 2011-2013. Among the 547 participants with newly diagnosed HIV with polymerase sequences, 465 sex partners were reported, of whom only 35 (7.5%) had HIV sequences.

In contrast, phylodynamic inference identified 102 unreported transmission links, including 12 between persons with AHI. Importantly, all putative transmission links between persons with AHI were found among large clusters with more than five members. Taken together, the presence of putative links between acute participants who did not name each other as contacts that are found only among large clusters underscores the potential for unobserved or undiagnosed intermediaries.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an integrated health system specialty pharmacy service with a clinic-embedded, HIV-trained pharmacist and pharmacy technician on ARV medication adherence rate, viral load, and CD4 count. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted from August 7, 2017, to June 30, 2018, at an indigent outpatient infectious disease clinic within Atrium Health (AH), a not-for-profit health system based in Charlotte, NC. The intervention group (opt-in group) received HIV patient care that involved the health system specialty pharmacy service. Once a patient was enrolled in the specialty pharmacy service, medication reconciliation was completed by the pharmacist, financial assistance and prior authorizations were completed if needed; prescriptions were delivered to the patient; and monthly refills calls were conducted to assess adherence, tolerability, and medication changes. The control group (opt-out group) received HIV patient care that did not incorporate the health system specialty pharmacy. The primary endpoints were medication adherence, viral suppression, and CD4 counts. Within-group comparisons from baseline to follow-up were made along with group-to-group comparisons. Adherence was calculated using medication possession ratio. RESULTS: For those patients using Atrium Health Specialty Pharmacy Service (AH SPS; n = 46), the overall median adherence rate was higher at 100% versus only 94% for those patients (n = 50) that opted out of the service (P < 0.01). All but 3 patients (21.7% at baseline vs. 6.5% at follow-up, P = 0.03) using AH SPS reached viral suppression, and all but 1 had improved immune function with a CD4 count of 200 or greater by the end of the observation period (P = 0.03). The change in viral suppression and CD4 count of 200 or greater was not statistically improved between baseline and follow-up in those opting out of using AH SPS.

Beginning in 2018, selected prescription drug classes were added to the models as risk markers. OBJECTIVE: We describe the motivations, concerns, methodology, and results of adding prescription drug utilization to the HHS-HCC models. METHODS: Separate HHS-HCC models are estimated by enrollee age and plan actuarial value. We defined and added 10 prescription drug classes, called RXCs, to the HHS-HCC adult models. RESULTS: Using selected RXCs alongside demographic and diagnostic indicators yielded modest overall improvement in HHS-HCC models' predictive power. Also, adding RXCs captures the higher costs of enrollees taking certain expensive pharmaceuticals and allows imputation of diagnoses for enrollees utilizing a drug but lacking the associated diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Including selected drugs in risk adjustment improved the models' predictive power. In addition, inclusion of selected drugs may discourage insurers from using formulary and drug benefit design to avoid enrollment of patients taking high-cost drugs, such as for HIV, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and improve access for enrollees taking these drugs. Adding RXCs also may improve plan risk measurement for plans with less complete diagnosis reporting.\")\n",

Historically, in pregnant women living with HIV, the third agent in triple therapy has been either non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors (PIs). PIs have been the preferred agents because of their robustness from the perspective of viral resistance and the dominant drug class for the management of HIV during pregnancy for the previous decade. As with many drugs used during pregnancy, pharmacokinetic changes decrease exposure to these agents as the pregnancy progresses. This can lead to viral escape at the time of pregnancy and ultimately increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. TDM has been well-established for this class of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and appropriate dose adjustment studies have been performed. At present, there is a shift from the traditional treatment paradigm in pregnancy to a new drug class, integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Although INSTIs are affected by pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy, they do not harbor the same issues with viral escape as seen with PIs at birth and in general eliminate the need for boosting with additional agents like ritonavir (r) and cobicistat (c) [bar elvitegravir (EVG)] that can lead to interactions with treatment of other common infections in HIV, including tuberculosis. Furthermore, INSTIs are the most successful medication for rapidly reducing the viral load (VL) in HIV patients, a useful factor where VL may be unknown, or in late presenters. These merits make INSTIs the best choice in pregnancy, although their use has been hindered in recent years by a report of neural tube defects from a large African study with dolutegravir (DTG). New data from Botswana and Brazil indicate that this risk is less significant than previously reported, necessitating further data to shed light on this critical issue. Current international guidelines including DHHS, EACS, WHO, and BHIVA (for patients with VLs >100,000 copies/mL or late presenters) now recommend INSTIs as first-line agents. The role of TDM in INSTIs shifts to cases of insufficient viral suppression with standard adherence measures, cases of drug-drug interactions, or cases where EVG/c is continued throughout pregnancy, and thus remains an important aspect of HIV care in pregnancy.')\n",

RESULTS: The annual cost of PrEP provision ranges between $75 and $134 per person. PrEP provision adolescents and young adults, regardless of risk behaviour, will each avert 3.2--4.8% of HIV infections over 20 years; provision to high-risk individuals only has similar impact at lower total cost.

Results: Men living with HIV had 1.79 times higher odds for liver fibrosis than women living with HIV (p = 0.038). African American women had higher CD4 count (p = 0.001) and lower HIV viral load (p = 0.011) compared to African American men. Fewer women (PLWH and HIV seronegative) smoked cigarettes (p = 0.002), and fewer had hazardous or harmful alcohol use (p < 0.001) than men. Women also had higher body mass index (kg/m(2)) (p < 0.001) compared to men. No significant association was noted among HIV seronegative participants for liver fibrosis by sex differences or cocaine use. Among African Americans living with HIV, cocaine users were 1.68 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than cocaine nonusers (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Sex differences and cocaine use appear to affect liver disease among African Americans living with HIV pointing to the importance of identifying at-risk individuals to improve outcomes of liver disease.')\n",

To elucidate the effects of urban tree canopy on mortality during tuberculosis treatment, we evaluated patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis in California from 2000 through 2012, obtaining patient data from the California tuberculosis registry. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality during tuberculosis treatment. We determined percent tree cover using 1 mresolution color infrared orthoimagery categorized into land cover classes, then linked tree cover to four circular buffer zones of 50-300 m radii around patient residential addresses. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival probabilities and Cox regression models to determine mortality hazard ratios, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical covariates. Our cohort included 33,962 tuberculosis patients of median age 47, 59% male, 51% unemployed, and 4.9% HIV positive. Tuberculosis was microbiologically confirmed in 79%, and 1.17% were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Median tree cover was 7.9% (50 m buffer). Patients were followed for 23,280 person-years with 2370 deaths during tuberculosis treatment resulting in a crude mortality rate of 1018 deaths per 10,000 person-years. Increasing tree cover quintiles were associated with decreasing mortality risk during tuberculosis treatment in all buffers, and the magnitude of association decreased incrementally with increasing buffer radius: In the 50 m buffer, patients living in neighborhoods with the highest quintile tree cover experienced a 22% reduction in mortality (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.68-0.90) compared to those living in lowest quintile tree cover; whereas for 100, 200, and 300 m buffers, a 21%, 13%, and 11% mortality risk reduction was evident. In conclusion, urban tree canopy was associated with decreased mortality during tuberculosis treatment even after adjusting for multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors, suggesting that trees might play a role in improving tuberculosis outcomes.')\n",

METHODOLOGY: Data were collected at two levels: first, interviews were conducted with informants to identify venues where FSWs and MSM frequent. Secondly, the size of MSM and FSWs were estimated through interviews with FSWs, MSM and other informants at the venue. The venue estimates were aggregated to generate the ward level estimates. Correction factors were then applied to adjust for MSM/FSW counted twice or more, absent from the venues on the mapping day or remain online and hidden. The ward size estimates for mapped wards were extrapolated to non-mapped wards and aggregated to generate district and regional level estimates. RESULTS: A total of 4,557 level I interviews were conducted. Further, 3,098 FSWs and 1,074 other informants at the FSWs venues and 558 MSM and 210 other informants at the MSM venues were interviewed during level II.

HIV co-infected persons are particularly vulnerable to the serious and potentially fatal consequences of untreated helminth infection. While general screening guidelines exist for parasitic infection screening in immigrant populations, they remain silent on HIV positive populations. This study assessed the seroprevalence, epidemiology and laboratory characteristics of these two parasitic infections in a non-endemic setting in an immigrant/refugee HIV positive community. METHODS: Between February 2015 and 2018 individuals born outside of Canada receiving care at the centralized HIV clinic serving southern Alberta, Canada were screened by serology and direct stool analysis for schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis. Canadian born persons with travel-based exposure risk factors were also screened. Epidemiologic and laboratory values were analyzed using bivariate logistic regression. We assessed the screening utility of serology, direct stool analysis, eosinophilia and hematuria. RESULTS: 253 HIV positive participants were screened. The prevalence of positive serology for Schistosoma and Strongyloides was 19.9 and 4.4%, respectively. Age between 40 and 50 years (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.13-5.50), refugee status (3.55, 1.72-7.33), country of origin within Africa (6.15, 2.44-18.60), eosinophilia (3.56, 1.25-10.16) and CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) (2.46, 1.02-5.92) were associated with positive Schistosoma serology. Eosinophilia (11.31, 2.03-58.94) was associated with positive Strongyloides serology. No Schistosoma or Strongyloides parasites were identified by direct stool microscopy. Eosinophilia had poor sensitivity for identification of positive serology. Hematuria was not associated with positive Schistosoma serology. CONCLUSION: Positive Schistosoma and Strongyloides serology was common in this migrant HIV positive population receiving HIV care in Southern Alberta. This supports the value of routine parasitic screening as part of standard HIV care in non-endemic areas. Given the high morbidity and mortality in this relatively immunosuppressed population, especially for Strongyloides infection, screening should include both serologic and direct parasitological tests. Eosinophilia and hematuria should not be used for Schistosoma and Strongyloides serologic screening in HIV positive migrants in non-endemic settings.')\n",

The proportion of defective proviruses increases during cART, but the dynamics of this process are not well understood, and a quantitative analysis of how the proviral landscape is reshaped after cART is initiated is critical to understanding how HIV persists. Here, we studied longitudinal samples from HIV infected individuals undergoing long term cART using multiplexed Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) approaches to quantify the proportion of deleted proviruses in lymphocytes. In most individuals undergoing cART, HIV proviruses that contain gag are lost more quickly than those that lack gag. Increases in the fraction of gag-deleted proviruses occurred only after 1-2 years of therapy, suggesting that the immune system, and/or toxicity of viral re-activation helps to gradually shape the proviral landscape. After 10-15 years on therapy, there were as many as 3.5-5 times more proviruses in which gag was deleted or highly defective than those containing intact gag. We developed a provirus-specific ddPCR approach to quantify individual clones. Investigation of a clone of cells containing a deleted HIV provirus integrated in the HORMAD2 gene revealed that the cells underwent a massive expansion shortly after cART was initiated until the clone, which was primarily in effector memory cells, dominated the population of proviruses for over 6 years. The expansion of this HIV-infected clone had substantial effects on the overall proviral population.')\n",

Interactions between the capsid domains (CA) of Gag result in Gag multimerization, leading to an immature virus particle that is formed by a protein lattice based on dimeric, trimeric, and hexameric protein contacts. Among retroviruses the inter- and intra-hexamer contacts differ, especially in the N-terminal sub-domain of CA (CANTD). For HIV-1 the cellular molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) interacts with and stabilizes the immature hexamer, and is required for production of infectious virus particles. We have used in vitro assembly, cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and mutational analyses to study the HIV-related lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). In particular, we sought to understand the structural conservation of the immature lentivirus lattice and the role of IP6 in EIAV assembly. Similar to HIV-1, IP6 strongly promoted in vitro assembly of EIAV Gag proteins into virus-like particles (VLPs), which took three morphologically highly distinct forms: narrow tubes, wide tubes, and spheres. Structural characterization of these VLPs to sub-4A resolution unexpectedly showed that all three morphologies are based on an immature lattice with preserved key structural components, highlighting the structural versatility of CA to form immature assemblies. A direct comparison between EIAV and HIV revealed that both lentiviruses maintain similar immature interfaces, which are established by both conserved and non-conserved residues. In both EIAV and HIV-1, IP6 regulates immature assembly via conserved lysine residues within the CACTD and SP. Lastly, we demonstrate that IP6 stimulates in vitro assembly of immature particles of several other retroviruses in the lentivirus genus, suggesting a conserved role for IP6 in lentiviral assembly.')\n",

A two-year analysis assessed the costs of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the 12 months before TA (Phase I-April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017) and the 12 months following (Phase II-April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018). The analysis involved interviewing staff at ten facilities throughout Namibia, collecting data on resources utilized in the treatment of ART patients and analyzing how costs changed before and after the introduction of TA. An analysis of treatment costs indicated that the unit cost of treatment declined from USD360 per patient per year in Phase I to USD301 per patient per year in Phase II, a reduction of 16%. This decline in unit costs was driven by 3 factors: 1) shifts in antiretroviral (ARV) regimens that resulted in lower costs for drugs and consumables, 2) negotiated reductions in the cost of viral load tests and 3) declines in personnel costs. It is unlikely that the first two of these factors were significantly influenced by the introduction of TA. It is unclear if TA might have had an influence on personnel costs. The reduction in personnel costs may have either represented a positive development (fewer personnel costs associated with increased numbers of healthier patients and fewer visits required) or alternatively may reflect constraints in Namibia\\'s staffing. Prior to this study, it was expected that the introduction of TA would lead to a significant increase in the number of ART patients. However, there was less than a 4% increase in the number of adult patients at the 10 studied facilities. From a financial point of view, TA did not significantly increase the resources required in the ten sampled facilities, either by raising unit costs or significantly increasing the number of ART patients.')\n",

OBJECTIVES: As part of an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods study, we used qualitative inquiry to explore adherence information, motivation, and behavioral skills among HIV-infected racial and ethnic minority youth. Our secondary aim was to gain an understanding of the contextual factors surrounding adherence behavior. METHODS: The information-motivation-behavioral skills model (IMB model) was applied to identify the conceptual determinants of adherence behavior in our target population, along with attention to emergent themes. In-depth, individual, semistructured interviews, including open-ended questions with probes, were conducted with a convenience sample of HIV-infected racial and ethnic minority youth (ages 16-29 years), receiving ART and with evidence of virologic failure (i.e., detectable HIV viral load). New participants were interviewed until information redundancy was reached. Qualitative interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Atlas.ti (v8). Directed content analysis was performed to generate categories and broad themes. Coding was initially conceptually driven (IMB model) and shifted to a data-driven approach, allowing for the discovery of key contextual factors that influence adherence behavior in this population. Methodological rigor was ensured by member checks, an audit trail, thick descriptive data, and triangulation of data sources. RESULTS: Twenty racial and ethnic minority participants (mean age = 24.3 years, 55.0% male) completed interviews. We found adherence information was understood in relation to HIV biomarkers; adherence motivation and behavioral skills were influenced by stigma and social context. We identified five primary themes regarding ART self-management: (a) emerging adulthood with a chronic illness, (b) stigma and disclosure concerns, (c) support systems and support deficits, (d) mental and behavioral health risks and challenges, and (e) mode of HIV transmission and perceptions of power and control. DISCUSSION: Key constructs of the IMB model were applicable to participating HIV-infected youth yet did not fully explain the essence of adherence behavior.

Because infancy is a time of rapid progression from primary infection to active TB disease, it is important to define when and how TB preventive interventions exert their effect in order to develop effective prevention strategies in this high-risk population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a non-blinded randomised controlled trial to determine efficacy of isoniazid (INH) to prevent primary Mtb infection among HEU children. Target sample size is 300 (150 infants in each arm). Children are enrolled at 6 weeks of age from maternal and child health clinics in Kenya and are randomised to receive 12 months of daily INH ~10 mg/kg plus pyridoxine or no INH. The primary endpoint is Mtb infection, assessed by interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) or tuberculin skin test after 12 months post-enrolment. Secondary outcomes include severe adverse events, expanded Mtb infection definition using additional QFT-Plus supernatant markers and determining correlates of Mtb infection. Exploratory analyses include a combined outcome of TB infection, disease and mortality, and sensitivity analyses excluding infants with baseline TB-specific responses on flow cytometry. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: An external and independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board monitors adverse events.

Here, we develop an iterative experimental and computational approach to map the HIV-1 innate response circuitry in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). By integrating genome-wide chromatin accessibility with expression kinetics, we infer a gene regulatory network that links 542 transcription factors with 21,862 target genes. We observe that an interferon response is required, yet insufficient, to drive MDDC maturation and identify PRDM1 and RARA as essential regulators of the interferon response and MDDC maturation, respectively.

We investigated NAT2 polymorphisms and their effect on isoniazid pharmacokinetics (PK) in Zulu black HIV-infected South Africans in Durban, South Africa. HIV-infected participants with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled from two unrelated studies. Participants with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB were genotyped for the NAT2 polymorphisms 282C>T, 341T>C, 481C>T, 857G>A, 590G>A, and 803A>G using Life Technologies prevalidated TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Participants underwent sampling for determination of plasma isoniazid and N-acetyl-isoniazid concentrations. Among the 120 patients, 63/120 (52.5%) were slow metabolizers (NAT2*5/*5), 43/120 (35.8%) had an intermediate metabolism genotype (NAT2*5/12), and 12/120 (11.7%) had a rapid metabolism genotype (NAT2*4/*11, NAT2*11/12, and NAT2*12/12). The NAT2 alleles evaluated in this study were *4, *5C, *5D, *5E, *5J, *5K, *5KA, *5T, *11A, *12A/12C, and *12M. NAT2*5 was the most frequent allele (70.4%), followed by NAT2*12 (27.9%). Fifty-eight of 60 participants in study 1 had PK results. The median area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-infinity) was 5.53 (interquartile range [IQR], 3.63 to 9.12 mug h/ml), and the maximum concentration (C max) was 1.47 mug/ml (IQR, 1.14 to 1.89 mug/ml). Thirty-four of 40 participants in study 2 had both PK results and NAT2 genotyping results. The median AUC0-infinity was 10.76 mug.h/ml (IQR, 8.24 to 28.96 mug.h/ml), and the C max was 3.14 mug/ml (IQR, 2.39 to 4.34 mug/ml). Individual polymorphisms were not equally distributed, with some being represented in small numbers. The genotype did not correlate with the phenotype, with those with a rapid acetylator genotype showing higher AUC0-infinity values than those with a slow acetylator genotype, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.43). There was a high prevalence of slow acetylator genotypes, followed by intermediate and then rapid acetylator genotypes. The poor concordance between genotype and phenotype suggests that other factors or genetic loci influence isoniazid metabolism, and these warrant further investigation in this population.')\n",

The networks may themselves form a consortium or may contribute to a wider research agenda within a consortium with colleagues from other disciplines. The purpose of a QRN is to ensure robust methods and processes that enable comparisons across contexts. Under the Self-Testing Africa (STAR) initiative and the REACHOUT project on community health systems, QRNs were established, bringing together researchers across countries to coordinate multi-country qualitative research and to ensure robust methods and processes allowing comparisons across contexts. QRNs face both practical challenges in facilitating this iterative exchange process across sites and conceptual challenges interpreting findings between contexts. This paper distils key lessons and reflections from both QRN experiences on how to conduct trustworthy qualitative research across different contexts with examples from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Indonesia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. METHODS: The process of generating evidence for this paper followed a thematic analysis method: themes initially identified were refined during several rounds of discussions in an iterative process until final themes were agreed upon in a joint learning process. RESULTS: Four guiding principles emerged from our analysis: a) explicit communication strategies that sustain dialogue and build trust and collective reflexivity; b) translation of contextually embedded concepts; c) setting parameters for contextualizing, and d) supporting empirical and conceptual generalisability. Under each guiding principle, we describe how credibility, dependability, confirmability and transferability can be enhanced and share good practices to be considered by other researchers. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative research is often context-specific with tools designed to explore local experiences and understandings. Without efforts to synthesise and systematically share findings, common understandings, experiences and lessons are missed. The logistical and conceptual challenges of qualitative research across multiple partners and contexts must be actively managed, including a shared commitment to continuous 'joint learning' by partners. Clarity and agreement on concepts and common methods and timelines at an early stage is critical to ensure alignment and focus in intercountry qualitative research and analysis processes. Building good relationships and trust among network participants enhance the quality of qualitative research findings.\")\n",

Yet, its mutation rate is higher than that of viruses like HIV, for which no effective vaccine exists. To investigate this, we infer a fitness model for the poliovirus viral protein 1 (vp1), which successfully predicts in vitro fitness measurements. This is achieved by first developing a probabilistic model for the prevalence of vp1 sequences that enables us to isolate and remove data that are subject to strong vaccine-derived biases. The intrinsic fitness constraints derived for vp1, a capsid protein subject to antibody responses, are compared with those of analogous HIV proteins. We find that vp1 evolution is subject to tighter constraints, limiting its ability to evade vaccine-induced immune responses. Our analysis also indicates that circulating poliovirus strains in unimmunized populations serve as a reservoir that can seed outbreaks in spatio-temporally localized sub-optimally immunized populations.')\n",

An rVSV vector expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) in place of HIV-1 gag (rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1) showed single-dose protection from lethal challenge with low passage Ebola virus in non-human primates. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1 vaccine in healthy adults. METHODS: We did a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study at a single clinical site (Optimal Research) in Melbourne, FL, USA. Eligible participants were healthy men and non-pregnant women aged 18-60 years, with a body-mass index (BMI) of less than 40 kg/m(2), no history of filovirus infection, VSV infection, or receipt of rVSV in previous studies, and who had not visited regions where Ebola virus outbreaks have occurred. Three cohorts were enrolled to assess a low (2.5 x 10(4) plaque forming units [PFU]), intermediate (2 x 10(5) PFU), or high dose (1.8 x 10(6) PFU) of the vaccine. Participants within each cohort were randomly allocated (10:3) to receive vaccine or placebo by intramuscular injection in a homologous prime and boost regimen, with 4 weeks between doses. All syringes were masked with syringe sleeves; participants and study site staff were not blinded to dose level but were blinded to active vaccine and placebo. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability; immunogenicity, assessed as GP-specific humoral immune response (at 2 weeks after each dose) and cellular immune response (at 1 and 2 weeks after each dose), was a secondary outcome. All randomised participants were included in primary and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02718469. FINDINGS: Between Dec 22, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 39 individuals (18 [46%] men and 21 [54%] women, mean age 51 years [SD 10]) were enrolled, with ten participants receiving the vaccine and three participants receiving placebo in each of three cohorts. One participant in the intermediate dose cohort was withdrawn from the study because of a diagnosis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma 24 days after the first vaccination, which was considered unrelated to the vaccine. No severe adverse events were observed. Solicited local adverse events occurred in ten (26%) of 39 participants after the first dose and nine (24%) of 38 participants after the second dose; the events lasted 3 days or less, were predominantly injection site tenderness (17 events) and injection site pain (ten events), and were either mild (19 events) or moderate (ten events) in intensity. Systemic adverse events occurred in 13 (33%) of 39 participants after the first dose and eight (21%) of 38 participants after the second dose; the events were mild (45 events) or moderate (11 events) in severity, and the most common events were malaise or fatigue (13 events) and headache (12 events). Arthritis and maculopapular, vesicular, or purpuric rash distal to the vaccination site(s) were not reported. A GP-specific IgG response was detected in all vaccine recipients after two doses (and IgG response frequency was 100% after a single high dose), and an Ebola virus neutralising response was detected in 100% of participants in the high-dose cohort. INTERPRETATION: The rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1 vaccine was well tolerated at all dose levels tested and was immunogenic despite a high degree of attenuation. The combined safety and immunogenicity profile of the rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1 vaccine vector support phase 1-2 clinical evaluation.

However, the proportion of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA) missing school, studying with difficulties and dropping out of school in Uganda has been observed to be higher than that of other youth. This study aimed at understanding the barriers and facilitators for YLWHA in Uganda to attend school. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative inquiry with 35 purposively selected YLWHA aged 12 to 19 years, including 16 females at three accredited Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment centres in Kabarole district in Western Uganda. Individual semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic inductive analysis. RESULTS: We identified five main themes in which barriers to attend school were reported and four main themes in which facilitators were reported by participants. The main themes for barriers were: 1) management of ART and illnesses, 2) fear, negative thoughts and self-devaluation, 3) lack of meaningful and supportive relationships, 4) reactionary attitudes and behaviours from others at school, 5) financial challenges. The main themes for facilitators were: 1) practical support at school, home and community, 2) counselling, encouragement and spirituality, 3) individual coping strategies, 4) hopes, dreams and opportunities for the future. CONCLUSION: Most of the barriers reported arose from HIV-related stigma and financial challenges whose genesis transcends school boundaries. While YLWHA reported measures to cope, and support from other people, these were non-sustainable and on a limited scale due to disclosure apprehension at school and the indiscretion of those who learnt about their status. To promote supportive school environments for YLWHA, integrated curricular and extracurricular interventions are necessary to increase HIV knowledge, dispel misconceptions about HIV and consequently transform the school community from a stigmatizing one to a supportive one.')\n",
